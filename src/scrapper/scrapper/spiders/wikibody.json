All six subspecies of this  nightjar  are  migratory , wintering in  sub-Saharan Africa . Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes them difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail in flight. The preferred habitat is dry, open country with some trees and small bushes. The breeding male has a churring trill, and patrols his  territory  with wings held in a V-shape. The female lays two eggs directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17\u201321 days and the chicks  fledge  in another 16\u201317 days. Both \" Caprimulgus \" and the old name \"goatsucker\" refer to the myth that nightjars suckled she-goats, causing them to cease to give milk. Its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classed by the  IUCN  as being of  least concern Full\u00a0article... \nRecently featured:  Battle of Oroscopa Paige Bueckers Uro\u0161 Drenovi\u0107 Archive By email More featured articles Did you know\u00a0...

Individual contributors, also called editors, are known as  Wikipedians . Wikipedia is the largest and most-read  reference work  in history. [3]  It is consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by  Alexa ; as of 2022, [update]  Wikipedia was ranked the 10th most popular site. [3] [4]  It is hosted by the  Wikimedia Foundation , an  American non-profit organization  funded mainly through donations. [5] On January 15, 2001,  Jimmy Wales [6]  and  Larry Sanger  launched Wikipedia; Sanger coined its name as a  portmanteau  of \"wiki\" and \"encyclopedia.\" [7] [8]  Wales was influenced by the \" spontaneous order \" ideas associated with  Friedrich Hayek  and the  Austrian School  of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and  Mises Institute  Senior Fellow  Mark Thornton [9]  Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 58 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per second) as of November\u00a02020 [update] [10] [11]  In 2006,  Time  magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the \"biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world.\" [6] Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the  democratization of knowledge , extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but  criticism  for exhibiting  systemic bias , particularly  gender bias  against women and alleged  ideological bias [12] [13] Its reliability  was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over time; it has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. [3] [12] [14]  Its coverage of controversial topics  such as American politics  and major events  such as the COVID-19 pandemic  has received substantial media attention. It has  been censored by world governments , ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Nevertheless, it has  become an element of popular culture , with references in  books films , and  academic studies . In April 2018,  Facebook  and  YouTube  announced that they would help users detect  fake news  by suggesting  fact-checking links to related Wikipedia articles [15] [16] Contents 1 History 1.1 Nupedia 1.2 Launch and growth 1.3 Milestones 2 Current state 3 Openness 3.1 Restrictions 3.2 Review of changes 3.3 Vandalism 3.4 Edit warring 4 Policies and laws 4.1 Content policies and guidelines 5 Governance 5.1 Administrators 5.2 Dispute resolution 5.2.1 Arbitration Committee 6 Community 6.1 Studies 6.2 Diversity 7 Language editions 7.1 English Wikipedia editor numbers 8 Reception 8.1 Accuracy of content 8.2 Discouragement in education 8.2.1 Medical information 8.3 Coverage of topics and systemic bias 8.3.1 Coverage of topics and selection bias 8.3.2 Systemic biases 8.4 Explicit content 8.5 Privacy 8.6 Sexism 9 Operation 9.1 Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates 9.2 Software operations and support 9.3 Automated editing 9.4 Hardware operations and support 9.5 Internal research and operational development 9.6 Internal news publications 9.7 The Wikipedia Library 10 Access to content 10.1 Content licensing 10.2 Methods of access 10.2.1 Mobile access 10.3 Chinese access 11 Cultural impact 11.1 Trusted source to combat fake news 11.2 Readership 11.2.1 COVID-19 pandemic 11.3 Cultural significance 11.3.1 Awards 11.3.2 Satire 11.4 Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia 11.5 Publishing 11.6 Research use 12 Related projects 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 Further reading 16.1 Academic studies 16.2 Books 16.3 Book review-related articles 16.4 Learning resources 16.5 Other media coverage 16.5.1 General articles 16.5.2 Articles re Wikipedia usage patterns 17 External links History Main article:  History of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger Nupedia Main article:  Nupedia Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called  Nupedia Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful. [17]  Wikipedia began as a complementary project for  Nupedia , a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. [18]  It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of  Bomis , a  web portal  company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO  Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger editor-in-chief  for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. [1] [19]  Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia  Open Content  License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the  GNU Free Documentation License  at the urging of  Richard Stallman [20]  Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [21] [22]  while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a  wiki  to reach that goal. [23]  On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. [24] Launch and growth The  domains wikipedia.com  (later redirecting to  wikipedia.org ) and  wikipedia.org  were registered on January 12, 2001, [25]  and January 13, 2001, [26]  respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 [18]  as a single  English -language edition at www.wikipedia.com, [27]  and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [21]  Its policy of \"neutral point-of-view\" [28]  was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. [21]  Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit. [29] The Wikipedia home page on December 20, 2001 English Wikipedia editors with >100 edits per month [30] Number of English Wikipedia articles [31] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,  Slashdot  postings, and web  search engine  indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2003, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. [32] [33]  Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the  Yongle Encyclopedia  made during the  Ming Dynasty  in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600\u00a0years. [34] Citing fears of commercial  advertising  and lack of control, users of the  Spanish Wikipedia forked  from Wikipedia to create  Enciclopedia Libre  in February 2002. [35]  Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from  wikipedia.com  to  wikipedia.org [36] [37] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [38]  Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [39]  A team at the  Palo Alto Research Center  attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [40]  Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \" low-hanging fruit \"\u2014topics that clearly merit an article\u2014have already been created and built up extensively. [41] [42] [43] \nIn November 2009, a researcher at the  Rey Juan Carlos University  in  Madrid  found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [44] [45] The Wall Street Journal  cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [46]  Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology. [47]  Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\". [48]  A 2013  MIT Technology Review  article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. [49]  In July 2012,  The Atlantic  reported that the number of administrators was also in decline. [50]  In the November 25, 2013, issue of  New York  magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\" [51] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline. [52] [53] Milestones Cartogram  showing number of articles in each European language as of January\u00a02019. [update]  One square represents 10,000 articles. Languages with fewer than 10,000 articles are represented by one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color. In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten  most popular websites  in the US, according to  Comscore  Networks. With 42.9\u00a0million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing  The New York Times  (#10) and  Apple  (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3\u00a0million unique visitors. [54]  As of March\u00a02020 [update] , it ranked 13th [4]  in popularity according to  Alexa Internet . In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month. [55]  On February 9, 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia had 18\u00a0billion  page views  and nearly 500\u00a0million  unique visitors  a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\". [10]  Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \" stigmergic  accumulation\". [56] [57] \nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the  United States Congress \u2014the  Stop Online Piracy Act  (SOPA) and the  PROTECT IP Act  (PIPA)\u2014by  blacking out its pages for 24 hours [58]  More than 162\u00a0million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content. [59] [60] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for  The Economic Times  indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\" [61]  Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's  Knowledge Graphs  project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\" [61]  When contacted on this matter,  Clay Shirky , associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's  Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\" [61]  By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally. [62] In January 2013,  274301 Wikipedia , an  asteroid , was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the  Wikipedia Monument ; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as  Print Wikipedia . In April 2019, an Israeli  lunar lander Beresheet , crash landed on the surface of the  Moon  carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. [63] [64]  In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16\u00a0GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into  synthetic DNA [65] Current state Screenshot of  English Wikipedia 's article on  Earth , 30 March 2021 On January 23, 2020, the English-language Wikipedia, which is the largest language section of the online encyclopedia,  published its six millionth article By February 2020, Wikipedia ranked eleventh in the world in terms of Internet traffic. [66]  As a key resource for disseminating information related to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has partnered with Wikipedia to help combat the spread of misinformation. [67] [68] Wikipedia accepts cryptocurrency donations and  Basic Attention Token [69] [70] [71] Openness Differences between versions of an article are highlighted Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the  procrastination  principle [note 3]  regarding the security of its content. [72] Restrictions Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [73]  On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees. [74] [75]  A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it. [76]  A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only  administrators  can make changes. [77]  A 2021 article in the  Columbia Journalism Review  identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"[p]erhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\". [78] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the  German Wikipedia  maintains \"stable versions\" of articles [79]  which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012. [80]  Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [81] Wikipedia's editing interface Review of changes Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision. [note 4] [82]  On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's History page. Anyone can view the  latest changes  to articles, and anyone registered may maintain a  \"watchlist\"  of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [83] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low  transaction costs  of participating in a  wiki  created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\". [84] Vandalism Main article:  Vandalism on Wikipedia Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam. [85]  Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively. [86] American journalist  John Seigenthaler  (1927\u20132014), subject of the  Seigenthaler incident Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. [87] [88]  However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair. [89] In the  Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure  John Seigenthaler  in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the  assassination of John F. Kennedy [89]  It remained uncorrected for four months. [89]  Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of  USA Today  and founder of the  Freedom Forum First Amendment Center  at  Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [90] [91]  After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\". [89]  The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people. [92] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show,  Tosh.0 , to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [93] [94] Edit warring Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\". [95] [96]  It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, [97]  and criticized as creating a competitive [98]  and conflict-based [99]  editing culture associated with traditional masculine  gender roles [100] Policies and laws External video Wikimania 60 Minutes CBS , 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales at  Fosdem Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular,  copyright  laws) of the United States and of the US state of  Virginia , where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the \"five pillars\" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. [101]  Editors can  enforce these rules  by  deleting  or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [79] Content policies and guidelines According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is  encyclopedic  and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. [102]  A topic should also meet  Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\" [103]  which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [104]  It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. [105]  This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced. [106]  Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [107] Governance Further information:  Wikipedia:Administration Wikipedia's initial  anarchy  integrated  democratic  and hierarchical elements over time. [108] [109]  An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. [110] Administrators Editors in good standing in the community can request extra  user rights , granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \" adminship [111] [112]  which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits. [113] [114] By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. [115] Dispute resolution Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, [note 5]  seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n Arbitration Committee Main article:  Arbitration Committee The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [116]  functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). when?  Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and  anti-social behavior . When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [117] Community Main article:  Wikipedia community Play media Video of  Wikimania 2005 \u2014an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the  Wikimedia Foundation , was held in  Frankfurt am Main , Germany, August 4\u20138. Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [118] Play media Wikipedians and  British Museum  curators collaborate on the article  Hoxne Hoard  in June 2010 Wikipedia's community has been described as  cultlike [119]  although not always with entirely negative connotations. [120]  Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of  credentials , has been referred to as \" anti-elitism [121] Wikipedians sometimes award one another \"virtual barnstars\" for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [122] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [123]  As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. [124]  Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community\u00a0... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". [125]  In 2008, a  Slate  magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\" [126]  This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by  Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [127] The English Wikipedia has  6,491,062  articles,  43,474,056  registered editors, and  126,197  active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". [128]  Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, [128]  as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", [129]  but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their  IP addresses  cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n Studies A 2007 study by researchers from  Dartmouth College  found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia\u00a0... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\". [130]  Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\" [125]  However,  Business Insider  editor and journalist  Henry Blodget  showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\". [125] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [131] [132]  although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. [133]  According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\". [134] Diversity Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. [135]  Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including  Yale  and  Brown , gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. [136] Andrew Lih , a professor and scientist, wrote in  The New York Times  that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\". [137]  Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors. [138] Language editions Main article:  List of Wikipedias Distribution of the 58,668,491 articles in different language editions (as of April 28, 2022) [139] English  (11.1%) Cebuano  (10.4%) German  (4.6%) Swedish  (4.4%) French  (4.1%) Dutch  (3.6%) Russian  (3.1%) Spanish  (3%) Italian  (3%) Egyptian Arabic  (2.7%) Polish  (2.6%) Japanese  (2.3%) Vietnamese  (2.2%) Chinese  (2.2%) Waray  (2.2%) Arabic  (2%) Ukrainian  (2%) \u00a0Other (34.5%) Most popular edition of Wikipedia by country in January 2021. Most viewed editions of Wikipedia over time. Most edited editions of Wikipedia over time. There are currently 326 language editions of Wikipedia (also called  language versions , or simply  Wikipedias ). As of April 2022, the six largest, in order of article count, are the  English Cebuano German Swedish French , and  Dutch  Wikipedias. [140]  The second and fourth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating  bot Lsjbot , which as of 2013 [update]  had created about half the articles on the  Swedish Wikipedia , and most of the articles in the  Cebuano  and  Waray Wikipedias . The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\n In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each ( Russian Spanish Italian Egyptian Arabic Polish Japanese Vietnamese Chinese Waray Arabic Ukrainian  and  Portuguese ), seven more have over 500,000 articles ( Persian Catalan Serbian Indonesian Korean Norwegian  and  Finnish ), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000. [141] [140]  The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.4 million articles. As of January\u00a02021, [update]  the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.

A graph for pageviews of  Turkish Wikipedia  shows a large drop of roughly 80% immediately after the  block of Wikipedia in Turkey  was imposed in 2017. Since Wikipedia is based on the  Web  and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the  English edition ). These differences may lead to some conflicts over  spelling differences  (e.g.  colour  versus  color [144]  or points of view. [145] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not  licensed freely  may be used under a claim of  fair use [146] [147] [148] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\". [149]  Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). [150]  For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [151]  and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [152]  The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions [153] Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. [154] A study published by  PLOS One  in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the  English Wikipedia , and 25% for the  simple English Wikipedia [153] English Wikipedia editor numbers Number of editors on the English Wikipedia over time. On March 1, 2014,  The Economist , in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" [155]  The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by  The Economist  as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).  The Economist  reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n In contrast, the trend analysis published in  The Economist  presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. [155]  No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia. [156] Reception See also:  Academic studies about Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2018 Various Wikipedians have  criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [update] [157] [158] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits  systemic bias . In 2010, columnist and journalist  Edwin Black  described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". [159]  Articles in  The Chronicle of Higher Education  and  The Journal of Academic Librarianship  have criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [160] [161] [162] Journalists  Oliver Kamm  and  Edwin Black  alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic. [159] [163]  A 2008 article in  Education Next  Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and  spin [164] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\" [165] In 2022,  John Stossel  opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appears to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics. [166] In 2006, the  Wikipedia Watch  criticism website listed dozens of examples of  plagiarism  in the English Wikipedia. [167] Accuracy of content Main article:  Reliability of Wikipedia External audio The Great Book of Knowledge, Part 1 Ideas with  Paul Kennedy CBC , January 15, 2014 Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. [168]  However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  by the science journal  Nature  found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;  Britannica , about three.\" [169]  Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\" [170]  Others raised similar critiques. [171]  The findings by  Nature  were disputed by  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [172] [173]  and in response,  Nature  gave a rebuttal of the points raised by  Britannica [174]  In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the  Nature  effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in  Nature s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported  confidence intervals ), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small  sample size , 42 or 4 \u00d7 10 1  articles compared, vs >10 5  and >10 6  set sizes for  Britannica  and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [175] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [176]  Concerns have been raised by  PC World  in 2009 regarding the lack of  accountability  that results from users' anonymity, [177]  the insertion of false information, [178] vandalism , and similar problems.\n Economist  Tyler Cowen  wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [179] Amy Bruckman  has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\". [180] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [181]  Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [182]  Editors of traditional  reference works  such as the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  have questioned the project's  utility  and status as an encyclopedia. [183]  Wikipedia co-founder  Jimmy Wales  has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles. [184] External video Inside Wikipedia\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the PR Industry Deutsche Welle , 7:13 mins [185] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for  Internet trolls spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [82] [186] \nIn response to  paid advocacy editing  and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in  The Wall Street Journal , to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [187]  The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.  Katherine Maher , the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia. [187] [188] [189] [190] [191]  These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by  Stephen Colbert  on  The Colbert Report [192] A Harvard law textbook,  Legal Research in a Nutshell  (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\". [193] Discouragement in education This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. December 2020 Most university  lecturers  discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in  academic work , preferring  primary sources [194]  some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [195] [196]  Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [197]  Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten  emails  weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\" he said. [198] In February 2007, an article in  The Harvard Crimson  newspaper reported that a few of the professors at  Harvard University  were including Wikipedia articles in their  syllabi , although without realizing the articles might change. [199]  In June 2007, former president of the  American Library Association Michael Gorman  condemned Wikipedia, along with  Google , stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\". [200] In contrast, academic writing clarification needed  in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process. [201] Medical information See also:  Health information on Wikipedia On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for  The Atlantic  magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\" [202]  Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of  Amin Azzam  at the  University of San Francisco  to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve  Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by  James Heilman  to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. [202]  In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in  The Atlantic  titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\" [203]  Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\" [203] Coverage of topics and systemic bias See also:  Notability in the English Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia \u00a7\u00a0Systemic bias in coverage Parts of this article (those related to  d:Wikidata:Statistics/Wikipedia ) need to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2017 Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has  terabytes  of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [204]  The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see  deletionism and inclusionism [205] [206]  Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of  images of Muhammad  in the  English edition  of its  Muhammad  article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the  censorship of Wikipedia  by national authorities in China [207]  and Pakistan, [208]  amongst other countries.\n Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January\u00a02008 [update] [209] A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [209] Culture and Arts: 30% (210%) Biographies and persons: 15% (97%) Geography and places: 14% (52%) Society and social sciences: 12% (83%) History and events: 11% (143%) Natural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%) Technology and Applied Science: 4% (\u22126%) Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%) Health: 2% (42%) Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%) Thought and Philosophy: 1% (160%) These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the  New York Public Library for the Performing Arts  to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [210] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the  University of Minnesota  indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\". [211] Coverage of topics and selection bias Research conducted by Mark Graham of the  Oxford Internet Institute  in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is the most underrepresented. [212]  Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. [213] An editorial in  The Guardian  in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for  a list of female porn actors  than a  list of women writers [214]  Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in  Cape Town  sought to address. [138] Systemic biases When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics,  systemic bias  may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\". [48]  The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's  Technology Review  titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and  policy creep  on the  downward trend in the number of editors [49] Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, vague  for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions. [215]  It may more specifically follow the biases of  Internet culture , inclining to be young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases, intrinsically, may include an overemphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [215] Taha Yasseri  of the  University of Oxford , in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [216] [217]  His research examined the  counterproductive work behavior  of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the  statistical measurement  of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles  George W. Bush anarchism , and  Muhammad [217]  By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the  Oxford  study were for the articles covering  Croatia Scientology , and  9/11 conspiracy theories [217] Researchers from  Washington University  developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. [218] [219] Explicit content See also:  Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia  and  Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons For the government censorship of Wikipedia, see  Censorship of Wikipedia For Wikipedia's policy concerning censorship, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as  feces cadaver human penis vulva , and  nudity ) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.\n The site also includes  sexual content  such as images and videos of  masturbation  and  ejaculation , illustrations of  zoophilia , and photos from  hardcore pornographic  films in its articles. It also has non-sexual  photographs of nude children The Wikipedia article about  Virgin Killer a 1976 album from the  German rock band Scorpions \u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked  prepubescent  girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article  Virgin Killer  was blocked for four days by most  Internet service providers  in the United Kingdom after the  Internet Watch Foundation  (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers. [220] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on  Wikimedia Commons  contained child pornography, and were in violation of  US federal obscenity law [221] [222]  Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to  pedophilia  and one about  lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the  PROTECT Act of 2003 [223]  That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are  obscene under American law [223]  Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [224] Wikimedia Foundation  spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [225]  saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\" [225]  Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\". [226]  Critics, including  Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [227] Privacy One  privacy  concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \" public figure \" in the eyes of the law. [228] [note 6]  It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in  cyberspace  and the right to be anonymous in  real life meatspace \"). A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.\n In January 2006, a German court ordered the  German Wikipedia  shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of  Boris Floricic , aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's  right to privacy  or that of his parents was being violated. [229] Wikipedia has a \" Volunteer Response Team \" that uses Znuny, a  free and open-source software  fork of  OTRS [230]  to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [231] Sexism Main article:  Gender bias on Wikipedia Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of  sexism  and  harassment [232] [233] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language were reasons put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship. [234] Edit-a-thons  have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. [235] A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, found significant gender differences in: confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\" [236] Operation Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates Main article:  Wikimedia Foundation Katherine Maher  became the third executive director of Wikimedia in 2016, succeeding  Lila Tretikov , who had taken over from  Sue Gardner  in 2014. Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the  Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as  Wiktionary  and  Wikibooks . The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [237]  The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7\u00a0million and expenses of almost $29\u00a0million, with assets of $37.2\u00a0million and liabilities of about $2.3\u00a0million. [238] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named  Lila Tretikov  as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [239]  The  Wall Street Journal  reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\" [240] [241]  The same  Wall Street Journal  article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue ( paid advocacy ) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\" Walsh said. [240] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [242]  Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.\" [243] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called  Wikimedia movement affiliates . These include  Wikimedia chapters  (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikim\u00e9dia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the  Catalan language  community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n Software operations and support See also:  MediaWiki The operation of Wikipedia depends on  MediaWiki , a custom-made,  free  and  open source wiki software  platform written in  PHP  and built upon the  MySQL  database system. [244]  The software incorporates programming features such as a  macro language variables , a  transclusion  system for  templates , and  URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the  GNU General Public License  (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on  UseModWiki  written in  Perl  by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required  CamelCase  for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a  PHP wiki  engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by  Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the  exponentially increasing  demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by  Lee Daniel Crocker Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [245]  to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.\n In April 2005, a  Lucene  extension [246] [247]  was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from  MySQL  to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on  Elasticsearch [248] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension,  VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [249] [250] [251] [252]  It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\". [253]  The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n Automated editing Main article:  Wikipedia bots Computer programs called  bots  have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [254] [255] [256]  One controversial contributor,  Sverker Johansson , creating articles with his  bot  was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [257]  Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). [258]  Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. [255]  Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the  MH17 jet  incident in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. [259]  Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. [260] According to  Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [261] Hardware operations and support See also:  Wikimedia Foundation \u00a7\u00a0Hardware Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day. [262] needs update  As of 2021, [update]  page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of  Varnish  caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by  Apache Traffic Server [263]  Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [264]  Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the  Linux Virtual Server  software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. [265] Overview of system architecture as of April\u00a02020 [update] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated  clusters  of  Linux  servers with  Debian [266]  As of December\u00a02009, [update]  there were 300 in Florida and 44 in  Amsterdam [267]  By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an  Equinix  facility in  Ashburn, Virginia [268] [269]  In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in  Singapore , the first of its kind in Asia. [270] Internal research and operational development Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [49]  the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of  industrial organization  economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [271]  Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized \"Thank\" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [49] [253]  The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [272]  At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45\u00a0million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8\u00a0million and 11.3\u00a0million dollars annually. [272]  In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by  Bloomberg News  as being at $77\u00a0million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08\u00a0million and $19.2\u00a0million annually. [272] Internal news publications Community-produced news publications include the  English Wikipedia 's  The Signpost , founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator, and former chair of the  Wikimedia Foundation  board of trustees. [273]  It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other  Wikimedia projects , such as  Wikimedia Commons . Similar publications are the German-language  Kurier , and the Portuguese-language  Correio da Wikip\u00e9dia . Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the  Wikiworld  webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like  The Bugle  from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also several publications from the  Wikimedia Foundation  and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff and  This Month in Education The Wikipedia Library For information for Wikipedia editors, see  Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of  digital publications , so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. [274] [275]  Over  60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when  ICE Publishing  joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources \u2013 creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\" [276] Access to content Content licensing When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the  GNU Free Documentation License  (GFDL), a  copyleft  license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [277]  The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with  free software  programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the  Creative Commons license  was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [278]  Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the  Free Software Foundation  (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to  relicense its content to CC BY-SA  by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [279] [280] [281] [282] The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under  fair use  doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in  Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by  free content  licenses (e.g.  Creative Commons ' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via  Wikimedia Commons  repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [283] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [284] [285] Methods of access Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\n Websites : Thousands of \" mirror sites \" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are  Reference.com  and  Answers.com . Another example is  Wapedia , which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Mobile apps : A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on  hand-held devices , including both  Android  and  iOS  devices (see  Wikipedia apps ). (see also  Mobile access Search engines : Some web  search engines  make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include  Microsoft Bing  (via technology gained from  Powerset [286]  and  DuckDuckGo Compact discs, DVDs : Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on  optical discs . An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles. [287] [288]  The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles. [289]  There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well. [290] [291]  Also, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and  SOS Children , is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the  UK National Curriculum  and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world. [292]  The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes. Printed books : There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. [293] [294]  Since 2009, tens of thousands of  print-on-demand  books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company  Books LLC  and by three  Mauritian  subsidiaries of the German publisher  VDM [295] Semantic Web : The website  DBpedia , begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the  Wikidata  project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable  semantic  format,  RDF . As of April\u00a02021, [update]  it has 93,337,731 items. Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a  web crawler  is discouraged. [296]  Wikipedia publishes  \"dumps\"  of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 [update]  there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [297] Wikimedia Enterprise  is a for-profit solution to this.\n Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the  Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library  reference desk , with an accuracy of 55 percent. [298] Mobile access See also:  Help:Mobile access The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page, from August 3, 2019 Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard  web browser  through a fixed  Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the  mobile web  since July 2013,  The New York Times  on February 9, 2014, quoted  Erik M\u00f6ller , deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [10]  The article in  The New York Times  reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" [10] The New York Times  reports that M\u00f6ller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by  The New York Times  for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [10] Bloomberg Businessweek  reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. [299]  At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with  Sue Gardner  in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [241]  The  Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [300]  The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [301]  Later versions have also been released.\n Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the  Wireless Application Protocol  (WAP), via the  Wapedia  service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, [302]  located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the  iPhone Android -based devices or  WebOS -based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia  metadata , such as  geoinformation [303] [304] Wikipedia Zero  was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. [305]  It was discontinued in February 2018. [306] Andrew Lih  and  Andrew Brown  both maintain editing Wikipedia with  smartphones  is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of  MIT Technology Review  claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some  Wikipedians  use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the  status quo [49]  Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it. [307] [308] Chinese access Access to the  Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked  in  mainland China  since May 2015. [309] [310] [311]  This was done after Wikipedia started to use  HTTPS  encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult. [312] In 2017,  Quartz  reported that the Chinese government had begun creating an unofficial version of Wikipedia. However, unlike Wikipedia, the website's contents would only be editable by scholars from state-owned Chinese institutions. The article stated it had been approved by the  State Council of the People's Republic of China  in 2011. [313] Cultural impact Trusted source to combat fake news In 2017\u201318, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.  Noam Cohen , writing in  The Washington Post  states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out ' fake news [15]  As of November\u00a02020, [update]  Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.03 and the average daily time on site as 3:46 minutes. [4] Readership In February 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\" [10]  However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. [314] In addition to  logistic growth  in the number of its articles, [315]  Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [316]  About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, [317]  a good portion of which is related to academic research. [318]  The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365\u00a0million at the end of 2009. [319]  The  Pew  Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [320]  In 2011  Business Insider  gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4\u00a0billion if it ran advertisements. [321] According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [322] COVID-19 pandemic Main article:  Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic During the  COVID-19 pandemic , Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. [323] Cultural significance \"Wikipedia in webcomics\" redirects here. For the list of Wikipedia's appearances in webcomics, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia in webcomics Main article:  Wikipedia in culture Wikipedia Monument  in  S\u0142ubice , Poland (2014, by  Mihran Hakobyan Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [324] [325] [326]  The  Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on  same-sex marriage  in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the  Civil Marriage Act [327]  The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the  World Intellectual Property Organization [328] \u2014though mainly for  supporting information  rather than information decisive to a case. [329]  Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some  US intelligence agency  reports. [330]  In December 2008, the scientific journal  RNA Biology  launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the  RNA family  for publication in Wikipedia. [331] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [332] [333]  often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for  plagiarizing from Wikipedia [334] [335] [336] In 2006,  Time  magazine  recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with  YouTube Reddit MySpace , and  Facebook [337]  in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.\n In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on  BBC Radio 4 [338]  which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select group of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ( Google Facebook YouTube ) that they no longer need explanation.\n On September 28, 2007,  Italian  politician  Franco Grillini  raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of  freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [339] Play media Wikipedia, an introduction \u2013  Erasmus Prize  2015 Jimmy Wales  accepts the 2008  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award on behalf of Wikipedia On September 16, 2007,  The Washington Post  reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the  2008 US election campaign , saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\" [340]  An October 2007  Reuters  article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [341] Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. [342] A working group led by  Peter Stone  (formed as a part of the  Stanford -based project  One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence ) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\" [343] In a 2017 opinion piece for  Wired Hossein Derakhshan  describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the  open  and  decentralized web \" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with  social media  and  social networking services , the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the  Age of Enlightenment  tradition of  rationality  triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a  typographic  culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \" sapere aude lit. ''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of \"[d]are not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television\u2014how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\" [344] Awards Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [345]  The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual  Prix Ars Electronica  contest; this came with a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in  Austria  later that year. The second was a Judges'  Webby Award  for the \"community\" category. [346] In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\" [347] In September 2008, Wikipedia received  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with  Boris Tadi\u0107 Eckart H\u00f6fling , and  Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by  David Weinberger [348] In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual  Erasmus Prize , which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, [349]  and the  Spanish Princess of Asturias Award  on International Cooperation. [350]  Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony,  Jimmy Wales  praised the work of the  Asturian language  Wikipedia users. [351] Satire See also:  Category:Parodies of Wikipedia Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\n Comedian  Stephen Colbert  has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show  The Colbert Report  and coined the related term  wikiality , meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on\u2014the reality we just agreed on\". [192]  Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in  The Onion [352]  as well as the 2010  The Onion  article \"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\". [353] In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy  The Office , office manager ( Michael Scott ) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on  negotiation  tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [354]  Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. [355] My Number One Doctor \", a 2007 episode of the television show  Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which  Perry Cox  reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the  raw food diet  reverses the effects of  bone cancer  by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the  Battlestar Galactica  episode guide [356] In 2008, the comedy website  CollegeHumor  produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [357] The  Dilbert  comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\" [358] In July 2009,  BBC Radio 4  broadcast a comedy series called  Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [359] On August 23, 2013, the  New Yorker  website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit,  Manning , have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\" [360]  The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a  trans woman In December 2015,  John Julius Norwich  stated, in a letter published in  The Times  newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [361] [362] Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia Main article:  Wikimedia project Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the  Wikimedia Foundation . These other  Wikimedia projects  include  Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [363] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,  Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,  Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,  Wikinews , for citizen journalism, and  Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [364]  Another sister project of Wikipedia,  Wikispecies , is a catalogue of species. In 2012  Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, and  Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched.\n Publishing A group of Wikimedians of the  Wikimedia DC  chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (back left)  at the US National Archives The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g.  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [365] [366] [367] Nicholas Carr  wrote a 2005 essay, \"The amorality of  Web 2.0 \", that criticized websites with  user-generated content , like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote: \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\" [368]  Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance,  Chris Anderson , the editor-in-chief of  Wired Magazine , wrote in  Nature  that the \" wisdom of crowds \" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top  scientific journals , with their rigorous  peer review  process. [369] There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" said  Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of  The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton  and  George Eliot: the Last Victorian [370] Research use Wikipedia has been widely used as a  corpus  for linguistic research in  computational linguistics information retrieval  and  natural language processing . In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the  entity linking  problem, which is then called \"wikification\", [371]  and to the related problem of  word-sense disambiguation [372]  Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia. [373] In 2015, French researchers Jos\u00e9 Lages of the  University of Franche-Comt\u00e9  in  Besan\u00e7on  and Dima Shepelyansky of  Paul Sabatier University  in  Toulouse  published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. [374] [375] [376]  They used  PageRank CheiRank  and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\". [376] [377]  The study was updated in 2019. [378] A 2017  MIT  study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. [379] [380] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using  machine learning  and  artificial intelligence  to support various operations. One of the most important areas\u2014automatic detection of vandalism [381] [382]  and  data quality  assessment in Wikipedia. [383] In February 2022,  civil servants  from the UK's  Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities  were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the  Levelling Up White Paper  after journalists at  The Independent  noted that parts of the  document  had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on  Constantinople  and the  list of largest cities throughout history [384] Related projects Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986  BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on  BBC Micro  computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [385] Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.  Everything2 [386]  with many later being merged into the project (e.g.  GNE [387]  One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was  h2g2 , which was created by  Douglas Adams  in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n Subsequent collaborative  knowledge  websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia.  Some, such as  Susning.nu Enciclopedia Libre Hudong , and  Baidu Baike  likewise employ no formal review process, although some like  Conservapedia  are not as open. citation needed  Others use more traditional  peer review , such as  Encyclopedia of Life  and the online wiki encyclopedias  Scholarpedia  and  Citizendium . The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

Retrieved  March 26,  2021 There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

This page is for documenting and explaining the English Wikipedia  policy  on page protection. Are you trying to request protection of a page?

Pages are protected when a specific damaging event has been identified that can not be prevented through other means such as a  block . Otherwise, Wikipedia is built on the principle that  anyone can edit it , and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. This policy states in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and when each protection should and should not be applied.\n Protection is a technical restriction applied only by  administrators , although any user may  request protection . Protection can be  indefinite  or expire after a specified time. The various levels of protection are detailed below, and they can be applied to the page edit, page move, page create, and file upload actions. Even when a page is protected from editing, the  source code wikitext ) of the page can still be viewed and copied by anyone.\n A protected page is marked at its top right by a padlock icon, usually added by the  pp-protected  template.\n Contents 1 Types of protection 1.1 Full protection 1.1.1 Content disputes 1.1.2 Vandalism 1.1.3 \"History only\" review 1.1.4 Protected generic file names 1.1.5 Permanent protection 1.2 Template protection 1.3 Semi-protection 1.3.1 Guidance for administrators 1.4 Creation protection (salting) 1.5 Move protection 1.6 Upload protection 1.7 Pending changes protection 1.7.1 When to apply pending changes protection 1.8 Extended confirmed protection 1.9 Office actions 1.10 Cascading protection 2 Former deleted protections 2.1 Superprotect 2.2 Cascading semi-protection 2.3 Pending changes protection level\u00a02 3 Protection by namespace 3.1 Article talk pages 3.2 User talk pages 3.2.1 Blocked users 3.3 User pages 3.3.1 Deceased users 3.4 Protection of templates 3.5 Sandboxes 4 Available templates 5 See also 6 Notes Types of protection Shortcut WP:PPLIST The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages:\n Edit protection  protects the page from being  edited Move protection  protects the page from being  moved or renamed Creation protection  prevents a page (normally a previously  deleted  one) from being created (also known as \" salting Upload protection  prevents new versions of a file from being  uploaded , but it does not prevent editing to the file's description page (unless edit protection is applied). The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages:\n Pending changes protection (only available for edit protection)  means edits by unregistered and new editors are not visible to readers who are not logged-in until the edits are approved by a  reviewer  or an administrator. Semi-protection  prevents the action by unregistered editors and editors with accounts that are not  confirmed Extended confirmed protection , also known as  30/500 protection , prevents the action by users without 30 days' tenure and 500 edits on the English Wikipedia. In most cases it should not be a protection level of first resort, and should be used where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. Its use is logged at the  Administrators' noticeboard Template protection  prevents the action by everyone except  template editors  and  administrators  (who have this right as part of their toolset). Full protection  prevents the action by everyone except  administrators Any type of protection (with the exception of  cascading protection ) may be requested at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection . Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding  talk page , then carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or there is  consensus  for them.\n Except in the case of  office actions  (see  below Arbitration Committee  remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace (see  below ), administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary. Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at  Requests for unprotection . Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first. A log of protections and unprotections is available at  Special:Log/protect Interaction of Wikipedia user groups and page protection levels\n Unregistered  or  Newly registered Confirmed  or  Auto-confirmed Extended confirmed Template editor Admin Interface admin Appropriate for\n No protection\n normal editing The vast majority of pages. (This is the default protection level.)\n Pending changes protection all users can edit. Edits by  unregistered or new editors  (and any subsequent edits by  anyone ) are hidden from readers who are not logged in, until reviewed by a  pending changes reviewer  or  admin . Logged-in editors see all edits, whether accepted or not.\n Infrequently edited pages with high levels of vandalism,  BLP  violations, edit-warring, or other disruption from unregistered and new users\n Semi-protection cannot edit normal editing Pages that are frequently edited by anonymous and registered users; some highly visible templates & modules\n Extended- confirmed prot. cannot edit normal editing Specific topic areas authorized by  ArbCom ; pages where semi-protection has failed;  high-risk templates  where template protection would be too restrictive\n Template prot. cannot edit normal editing High-risk  or very frequently used templates & modules; also  some  high-risk pages outside  template space Full protection cannot edit normal editing Articles with persistent disruption from extended confirmed accounts; critical templates & modules\n Interface protection cannot edit normal editing Scripts, stylesheets, and similar objects central to operation of the site\n  In order to edit through extended confirmed protection, a template editor must also be extended confirmed, but in practice this is essentially always the case.\n Other modes of protection:\n Create protection Move protection Upload protection Office protection Cascade protection view talk edit Full protection Shortcuts WP:FULL WP:GOLDLOCK A fully protected page cannot be edited or moved by anyone except  administrators . The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.\n Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit fully-protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Content disputes See also:  Wikipedia:Stable version \"WP:PREFER\" redirects here. For what title name should be preferred, see  Wikipedia:Disambiguation \u00a7\u00a0Primary topic While content disputes and  edit warring  may be addressed with user  blocks  issued by  uninvolved  administrators, allowing normal page editing by other editors at the same time, the protection policy provides an alternative approach as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war. This approach may better suit multi-party disputes and contentious content, as it makes talk page  consensus  a requirement for implementation of  requested edits Shortcut WP:PREFER When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as  vandalism copyright violations defamation , or  poor-quality coverage of living people . Administrators are deemed to remain uninvolved when exercising discretion on whether to apply protection to the current version of an article, or to an older,  stable , or pre-edit-war version.\n Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version  prior to  the edit war and  request  reversion to that version. Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.\n Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered  involved  and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions. When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.\n Vandalism Shortcuts WP:NO-PREEMPT WP:PREEMPTIVE Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons. However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring by multiple users and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.\n \"History only\" review Shortcut WP:PPDRV If a deleted page is going through  deletion review , only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page. If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may  restore  the page, blank it or replace the contents with  Temporarily undeleted  template or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing. The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the  page history  Protected generic file names Generic file names such as  File:Photo.jpg File:Map.jpg , and  File:Sound.wav  are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded. Furthermore,  File:Map.jpg  and  File:Sound.wav  are  salted Permanent protection Shortcuts WP:PPINDEF WP:REDLOCK Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia, which are permanently protected by the  MediaWiki  software:\n Edits to the  MediaWiki namespace , which defines parts of the site interface, are restricted to administrators.\n Edits to system-wide CSS and JavaScript pages such as  MediaWiki:common.js  are further restricted to  interface administrators Edits to personal CSS and JavaScript pages such as  User:Example/monobook.css  and  User:Example/cologneblue.js  are restricted to the associated user and interface administrators. Interface administrators may edit these pages, for example, to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way. Administrators may delete (but not edit or restore) these pages. Edits to personal JSON pages such as  User:Example/data.json  are restricted to the associated user and administrators. Such protection is called Permanent, Interface, or Indefinite protection; and pages so protected can only be edited by those with  Interface Administrator rights In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually fully protected for an indefinite period of time (though not necessarily with Interface protection):\n Pages that are very visible, such as the  Main Page Pages that should not be modified for copyright or legal reasons, such as the  general disclaimer  or the  local copy of the site copyright license Pages that are very frequently  transcluded , such as  tl  or  citation needed , to prevent  vandalism  or  denial of service  attacks. This includes images or templates used in other highly visible or frequently transcluded pages. See  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  for more information. Template protection Main page:  Wikipedia:Template editor Shortcuts WP:TPROT WP:PINKLOCK A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the Template editors group. This protection level should be used almost exclusively on  high-risk templates  and  modules . In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.\n This is a protection level [1]  that replaces  full protection  on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes. It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection. It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the  template editor  user right exists\u2014the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community. In borderline cases,  extended confirmed protection  or lower may be applied to high risk templates that the general editing community still needs to edit regularly.\n Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit template-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Semi-protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection Shortcuts WP:SEMI WP:SILVERLOCK Semi-protected pages cannot be edited by  unregistered users IP addresses ), as well as accounts that are not  autoconfirmed  (accounts that are at least four days old and have made at least ten edits to Wikipedia) or  confirmed . Semi-protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or  vandalism  from new or unregistered users, or to prevent  sockpuppets  of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on  biographies of living persons  who have had a recent high level of media interest. An alternative to semi-protection is  pending changes , which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.\n Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{ Edit semi-protected }} template if necessary to gain attention. If the page in question and its talk page are  both  protected, please make your edit request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection  instead. New users may also request the confirmed user right at  Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed Guidance for administrators Administrators may apply  indefinite  semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent  vandalism  or violations of  content policy  (such as  biographies of living persons neutral point of view ). Semi-protection should  not  be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred or to privilege registered users over unregistered users in (valid) content disputes.\n In addition, administrators may apply  temporary  semi-protection on pages that are:\n Subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to  media attention ) if  blocking  individual users is not a feasible option. Subject to  edit warring  if  all  parties involved are unregistered or new editors (i.e. in cases in which full protection would otherwise be applied). This does  not  apply when autoconfirmed users are involved. Subject to  vandalism  or  edit warring  where unregistered editors are engaging in  IP hopping  by using different computers, obtaining new addresses by using  dynamic IP  allocation, or other address-changing schemes. Article discussion pages, if they have been subject to persistent disruption. Such protection should be used sparingly because it prevents unregistered and newly registered users from participating in discussions. A page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time. If a page and its talk page are both protected, the talk page should direct affected editors to  Wikipedia:Request for edit  to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing. Protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users, including IP addresses. Instead the user should be re-blocked with talk page editing disallowed. When required, or when re-blocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful, protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block. Today's featured article  may be semi-protected just like any other article. But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances. For the former guideline, see  Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection Creation protection (salting) Shortcuts WP:SALT WP:SKYBLUELOCK Administrators can prevent the creation of pages. This level of protection is useful for pages that have been  deleted  but repeatedly recreated. Such protection is case-sensitive. There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection. A list of protected titles may be found at  Special:ProtectedTitles  (see also  historical lists Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the  title blacklist  system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for  substrings  and  regular expressions Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as \" salted \". Editors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an  administrator  (preferably the protecting administrator), file a request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection#Current requests for reduction in protection level , or use the  deletion review  process. To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a  draft version  of the intended article when filing a request.\n Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection\u2014autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, [2]  or full. Due to the implementation of  ACPERM , non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in  mainspace ; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.\n While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user (or  sockpuppets  of that user, if applicable).\n Move protection Shortcuts WP:MOVP WP:GREENLOCK Move-protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator. Move protection is commonly applied to:\n Pages subject to persistent page-move  vandalism Pages subject to a page-name dispute. Highly visible pages that have no reason to be moved, such as the  administrators' noticeboard  and articles selected as \" Today's featured article \" on the main page. Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.\n As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring  should not be considered an endorsement of the current name . When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.\n All  files  are implicitly move-protected; only  file movers  and administrators can rename files.\n Upload protection Shortcuts WP:UPLOAD-P WP:PURPLELOCK Upload-protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator. Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing. It may be applied by an administrator to:\n Files subject to persistent upload  vandalism Files subject to a dispute between editors. Files that should not be replaced, such as images used in the interface or transcluded to the main page. Files with common or generic names. (e.g.,  File:Map.png As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current version. An exception to this rule is when they are protected due to upload vandalism.\n Pending changes protection Further information:  Wikipedia:Pending changes Shortcuts WP:PCPP WP:WHITELOCK Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress  vandalism  and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits. Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi-protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from most readers until those changes are accepted by a  pending changes reviewer When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  unregistered  (IP addresses) editor or a  new user , the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the  pending changes reviewer right . When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  autoconfirmed user , the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers, unless there are pending edits waiting to be reviewed.\n Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review. Readers that are  not logged in  (the vast majority of readers) are shown the latest  accepted  version of the page;  logged-in  users see the latest version of the page, with all changes (reviewed or not) applied. When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.\n A user who clicks \"edit this page\" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing  regardless of whether the user is logged in or not If the editor is not logged in, their changes join any other changes to the article awaiting review\u00a0\u2013 for the present they remain hidden from not-logged-in users. (This means that when the editor looks at the article after saving, the editor won't see the change made.) If the editor is logged in and a pending changes reviewer, and there are pending changes, the editor will be prompted to review the pending changes before editing\u00a0\u2013 see  Wikipedia:Pending changes If the editor is logged in and not a pending changes reviewer, then If there are no unreviewed pending edits waiting, this editor's edits will be visible to everyone immediately; but If there are unreviewed pending edits waiting, then this editor's edits will be visible only to other logged-in users (including themself) immediately, but not to readers not logged in. Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.\n When to apply pending changes protection Pending changes may be used to protect articles against:\n Persistent vandalism Violations of the  biographies of living persons  policy Copyright violations Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. Like semi-protection, PC protection should  never  be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Instead, semi-protection should be considered.\n In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.\n Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at  requests for unprotection The reviewing process is described in detail at  Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes Extended confirmed protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to extended confirmed protection Shortcuts WP:ECP WP:BLUELOCK Extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, only allows edits by editors with the  extended confirmed  user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days' tenure and 500 edits.\n Where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption (such as  vandalism , abusive  sockpuppetry edit wars , etc.) on any topic. Extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered/new users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by Arbitration Committee 30/500 rulings. Extended confirmed protection may be applied at the discretion of an administrator when creation-protecting a page. [2] High-risk templates  may be extended-confirmed protected at administrator discretion when template protection would be too restrictive and semi-protection would be ineffective to stop widespread disruption. [3] Until August 12, 2016, [4]  30/500 protection applied only in topic areas determined by the  Arbitration Committee , which authorized its use on articles reasonably construed as belonging to the  Arab\u2013Israeli conflict [5]  as an arbitration enforcement tool by motion or remedy; [6]  or as a result of community consensus. [7]  In February 2019, the community authorized uninvolved administrators to place pages reasonably construed as belonging to the  India\u2013Pakistan conflict  under extended confirmed protection as part of a general sanctions regime. [8]  In May 2020 the Arbitration Committee authorized extended confirmed protection to pages related to the history of Jews and  antisemitism in Poland  during World War II (1933\u20131945). [9] As of September 23, 2016, a bot posts a notification in a subsection of  AN  when this protection level is used. [10]  Any protection made as arbitration enforcement must be logged at  Wikipedia:Arbitration enforcement log . A full list of the 3707 pages under 30/500 protection can be found  here Users can request edits to an extended confirmed-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit extended-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Office actions See also:  Wikipedia:Office actions Shortcuts WP:WMF-PRO WP:BLACKLOCK As outlined in  Meta-Wiki:Office actions#Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff , pages may be protected by  Wikimedia Foundation  staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel.  Such actions override community consensus . Administrators should  not  edit or unprotect such pages without permission from Wikimedia Foundation staff. [11] Cascading protection \"WP:CASCADE\" redirects here. You may also be looking for  Help:Cascading Style Sheets  or  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items Shortcuts WP:CASCADE WP:TURQUOISELOCK Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection  automatically  to any page that is  transcluded  onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly. This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia. Files stored on Commons are  not  protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and, if they are to be protected, must be either temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or explicitly protected at Commons (whether manually or through cascading protection there). When operational,  KrinkleBot  cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection  and  Main Page . As the bot's response time varies, media should  not  be transcluded on the main page (or its constituent templates) until after it has been protected. (This is particularly relevant to  Template:In the news , for which upcoming images are not queued at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow .) Cascading protection:\n Should be used only to prevent  vandalism  when placed on particularly visible pages, such as the main page. Is available only for fully protected pages; it is disabled for lower levels of protection as it represents a workflow flaw. See  below  as well as  this bug ticket  for more information. Is not instantaneous; it may be several hours before it takes effect. See  Phabricator:T20483  for more information. Should generally not be applied directly to templates or  modules , as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the  documentation subpage See  \u00a7\u00a0Protection of templates  below , for alternatives. The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items . Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at  Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items  as an  edit request Former deleted protections Superprotect Shortcut WP:SUPERPROTECT See also:  Meta-Wiki:Superprotect Superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by  Wikimedia Foundation employees who are in the Staff global group . It was  implemented on August 10, 2014  and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the  German Wikipedia 's primary site JavaScript,  common.js . It was never used on the English Wikipedia. On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to  remove  superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.\n Cascading semi-protection Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after  users noticed  that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.\n Pending changes protection level\u00a02 Shortcut WP:ORANGELOCK Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not  pending changes reviewers  to be reviewed. Following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017. It was suggested then that \"Pending changes level 1\" be referred to in the future as simply \"Pending changes\". [12] Protection by namespace Shortcut WP:PROTNS Article talk pages Shortcut WP:ATPROT \nModifications to a protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.\n User talk pages Shortcut WP:UTPROT User talk pages are rarely protected. However, protection may be applied if there is severe vandalism or abuse. Users whose talk pages are protected may wish to have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from users that the protection restricts editing from.\n A user's request to have their own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.\n Blocked users Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.\n In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{ unblock }} template, re-blocking the user with talk page access removed should be preferred over applying protection to the page. If the user has been blocked and with the ability to edit their user talk page disabled, they should be informed of this in a block notice, subsequent notice, or message, and it should include information and instructions for appealing their block off-wiki, such as through the  UTRS tool interface  or, as a last recourse,  the Arbitration Committee When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.\n Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with  Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry ; their pages are not normally protected.\n User pages Shortcuts WP:UPROT WP:UPPROT Base user pages (for example, the page User:Example, and not User:Example/subpage or User talk:Example) are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed accounts and anonymous IP users. An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered account attempting to create or edit their own user page. IP editors and unconfirmed accounts are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a currently-registered account. This protection is enforced by  an edit filter [13]  Users may opt-out of this protection by placing  unlocked userpage  anywhere on their own user page.\n User pages  and subpages within their own user space may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists. Pages within the user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected without good reason or cause. [14] [15]  Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.\n When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a \".css\" subpage (ex. User:Example/Userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting  {{User:Example/Userpage.css}}  on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. Because user space pages that end in \".css\", \".js\", and \".json\" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.\n Deceased users See also:  Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.\n Protection of templates Shortcut WP:PTPROT See also:  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  and  Wikipedia:Template documentation Highly visible templates\u00a0\u2013 those used on a large number of pages or frequently substituted\u00a0\u2013 are often edit protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, and other considerations.\n Protected templates should normally have the {{ documentation }} template. It loads the unprotected  /doc  page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. It also automatically adds {{ pp-template }} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. Only manually add  {{pp-template}}  to protected templates that don't use  {{documentation}}  (mostly the flag templates).\n Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the template's  documentation subpage . Instead, consider any of the following:\n If the set of subtemplates is static (even if large), protect them using normal protection mechanisms. If the set of subtemplates is unbounded, use  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist  to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format (as is done for  editnotice templates  and subtemplates of  Template:TFA title Note: All  editnotice templates  (except those in userspace) are already protected via  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist . They can be edited by admins,  template editors  and  page movers  only.\n Sandboxes See also:  Wikipedia:About the sandbox Sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with  wiki syntax . Most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users. The  Wikipedia:Sandbox  is cleaned every hour. Those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as  no personal attacks civility , or  copyrights , should instead be warned and/or blocked.\n Available templates The following templates may be added at the very top of a page to indicate that it is protected:\n Protection templates Edit Move Pending changes Upload  Generic pp pp-protected {{pp}} pp-move {{pp}} pp-pc {{pp}} pp-upload BLP pp-blp  Dispute pp-dispute pp-move-dispute Extended confirmed protection pp-extended pp-extended Main Page  Image pp-main-page Office pp-office pp-reset pp-office-dmca {{pp-office}} {{pp-reset}} {{pp-office-dmca}} {{pp-office}} {{pp-reset}} {{pp-office-dmca}}  Sockpuppetry pp-sock  High-visibility pp-template  Blocked user's talk pp-usertalk  Vandalism pp-vandalism pp-move-vandalism  Talk page permanently protected temporarily protected  Long-term pp-semi-indef pp-move-indef Module:Protection banner On redirect pages, use the {{ Redirect category shell }} template, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line. A protection template may also be added below the redirect line, but it will serve only to categorize the page, as it will not be visible on the page, and it will have to be manually removed when protection is removed.\n See also MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext Special:ProtectedPages Special:ProtectedTitles Wikipedia:Edit lock Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages Wikipedia:Requests for page protection Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection Wikipedia:Make protection requests sparingly , an essay Meta-Wiki:Protected pages considered harmful Meta-Wiki:The Wrong Version Wikipedia:Protection policy/Padlocks Notes Created October 2013 as a result of  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Template editor user right\u200e a b Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Extended confirmed protection policy 2 Should we use ECP on templates?  discussion at the village pump.

Please read up on the  protection policy . Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to  high-risk templates ; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the  rough guide to semi-protection ); and move protection is used to stop  pagemove  revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the  rough guide to extended confirmed protection After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on  Special:Protectedpages . Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of  obvious vandalism Note : Editors should  not  consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken.\n Skip to  table of contents requests to  raise protection lower protection requested edits (purge) Request  protection  of a page, or increasing the protection level Request protection Request  unprotection  of a page, or reducing the protection level Request unprotection Request a specific  edit  to a protected page Please request an edit directly on the protected page's  talk page  before posting here this header view edit Archives 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Administrator instructions Contents 1 Current requests for increase in protection level 1.1 Kenny Pickett (American football) 1.2 Example Article Name 1.3 Calicut International Airport 1.4 Kayvon Thibodeaux 1.5 Tasmania 1.6 Nauru 1.7 Flag of Nazi Germany 1.8 Upper Backward Castes 1.9 List of concentration and internment camps 1.10 OBJ 1.11 Renault F-Type engine 1.12 Renault D-Type engine 1.13 List of programs broadcast by Kapamilya Channel 2 Current requests for reduction in protection level 2.1 Philippine Airlines 3 Current requests for edits to a protected page 3.1 Lucifer Valentine 3.2 Steve Down 4 Handled requests Current  requests for increase  in protection level Request  protection  of a page, or increasing the protection level Request protection Shortcut WP:RPP/I Kenny Pickett (American football) Kenny Pickett (American football) edit talk history links watch logs Temporary semi-protection: BLP  policy violations.

It has been barred from editing for almost 11 years. I made a case on the talk page, which I will copy here.\nI am requesting recreation as Lucifer Valentine has received significant media attention since this page was locked in 2011. He has made many new movies, committed crimes, and been given awards. Additionally, with the way this is set up, we would have to make several pages for each individual movie that all include information on him, rather than have 1 page that discusses him connected to the several movie pages. He was also in a documentary called  Beyond Horror: The History and Sub-Culture of Red Films  in 2019 which means he meets notability guidelines. He's also mentioned  here here  and  here  . If he's notable enough to have a Fandago page and sell his 2015 movie (not in the Vomit Dolls triology) at Booksamillion, I'm sure he is notable enough for Wikipedia. He also has over 19 film credits now. \nLucifer Valentine is a widely discussed topic on social media, has several film nominations, has been featured in documentaries, and there is extensive content on him Wikipedia would be able to cover. This would make it much more user-friendly for all of his movie pages and provide reliable information on a highly sought after topic. Perhaps he was not as notable in 2011 when this page was locked, but there is a case to be made for his notability now.

Malcolmxl5 talk ) 11:08, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply I don't mind, but I highly suggest making a draft first and making sure that he passes notability guidelines. Keep in mind that having a Fandango page doesn't necessarily mean that someone is notable. Also, part of the issue here was that he was predominantly known for his Vomit Dolls trilogy, so the big emphasis here would be showing how he's notable for more than just that series. There are some  self-published sources  like blogs and so on that cover him, but coverage in places that Wikipedia would see as both reliable and notability giving are pretty slim. Some tend to focus on the Vomit Dolls trilogy or discuss his films as part of one ongoing series. Now that said, I do see coverage  here  and  here , as well as at  Ginger Nuts of Horror , which is good. But again, you need to establish how he's notable apart from his Vomit Dolls work. I highly recommend creating a draft before moving anything live and getting one of us to look it over - I don't mind taking a look. The page was deleted in the past so there's more chance that someone will try to renominate it unless it passes notability guidelines per  WP:NBIO  and has strong sourcing. There's a brochure on creating biography articles  here  that would definitely help with that.

All six subspecies of this  nightjar  are  migratory , wintering in  sub-Saharan Africa . Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes them difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail in flight. The preferred habitat is dry, open country with some trees and small bushes. The breeding male has a churring trill, and patrols his  territory  with wings held in a V-shape. The female lays two eggs directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17\u201321 days and the chicks  fledge  in another 16\u201317 days. Both \" Caprimulgus \" and the old name \"goatsucker\" refer to the myth that nightjars suckled she-goats, causing them to cease to give milk.

[5] On January 15, 2001,  Jimmy Wales [6]  and  Larry Sanger  launched Wikipedia; Sanger coined its name as a  portmanteau  of \"wiki\" and \"encyclopedia.\" [7] [8]  Wales was influenced by the \" spontaneous order \" ideas associated with  Friedrich Hayek  and the  Austrian School  of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and  Mises Institute  Senior Fellow  Mark Thornton [9]  Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 58 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per second) as of November\u00a02020 [update] [10] [11]  In 2006,  Time  magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the \"biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world.\" [6] Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the  democratization of knowledge , extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but  criticism  for exhibiting  systemic bias , particularly  gender bias  against women and alleged  ideological bias [12] [13] Its reliability  was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over time; it has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. [3] [12] [14]  Its coverage of controversial topics  such as American politics  and major events  such as the COVID-19 pandemic  has received substantial media attention. It has  been censored by world governments , ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Nevertheless, it has  become an element of popular culture , with references in  books films , and  academic studies . In April 2018,  Facebook  and  YouTube  announced that they would help users detect  fake news  by suggesting  fact-checking links to related Wikipedia articles [15] [16] Contents 1 History 1.1 Nupedia 1.2 Launch and growth 1.3 Milestones 2 Current state 3 Openness 3.1 Restrictions 3.2 Review of changes 3.3 Vandalism 3.4 Edit warring 4 Policies and laws 4.1 Content policies and guidelines 5 Governance 5.1 Administrators 5.2 Dispute resolution 5.2.1 Arbitration Committee 6 Community 6.1 Studies 6.2 Diversity 7 Language editions 7.1 English Wikipedia editor numbers 8 Reception 8.1 Accuracy of content 8.2 Discouragement in education 8.2.1 Medical information 8.3 Coverage of topics and systemic bias 8.3.1 Coverage of topics and selection bias 8.3.2 Systemic biases 8.4 Explicit content 8.5 Privacy 8.6 Sexism 9 Operation 9.1 Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates 9.2 Software operations and support 9.3 Automated editing 9.4 Hardware operations and support 9.5 Internal research and operational development 9.6 Internal news publications 9.7 The Wikipedia Library 10 Access to content 10.1 Content licensing 10.2 Methods of access 10.2.1 Mobile access 10.3 Chinese access 11 Cultural impact 11.1 Trusted source to combat fake news 11.2 Readership 11.2.1 COVID-19 pandemic 11.3 Cultural significance 11.3.1 Awards 11.3.2 Satire 11.4 Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia 11.5 Publishing 11.6 Research use 12 Related projects 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 Further reading 16.1 Academic studies 16.2 Books 16.3 Book review-related articles 16.4 Learning resources 16.5 Other media coverage 16.5.1 General articles 16.5.2 Articles re Wikipedia usage patterns 17 External links History Main article:  History of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger Nupedia Main article:  Nupedia Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called  Nupedia Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful. [17]  Wikipedia began as a complementary project for  Nupedia , a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. [18]  It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of  Bomis , a  web portal  company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO  Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger editor-in-chief  for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. [1] [19]  Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia  Open Content  License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the  GNU Free Documentation License  at the urging of  Richard Stallman [20]  Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [21] [22]  while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a  wiki  to reach that goal. [23]  On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. [24] Launch and growth The  domains wikipedia.com  (later redirecting to  wikipedia.org ) and  wikipedia.org  were registered on January 12, 2001, [25]  and January 13, 2001, [26]  respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 [18]  as a single  English -language edition at www.wikipedia.com, [27]  and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [21]  Its policy of \"neutral point-of-view\" [28]  was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. [21]  Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit. [29] The Wikipedia home page on December 20, 2001 English Wikipedia editors with >100 edits per month [30] Number of English Wikipedia articles [31] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,  Slashdot  postings, and web  search engine  indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2003, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. [32] [33]  Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the  Yongle Encyclopedia  made during the  Ming Dynasty  in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600\u00a0years. [34] Citing fears of commercial  advertising  and lack of control, users of the  Spanish Wikipedia forked  from Wikipedia to create  Enciclopedia Libre  in February 2002. [35]  Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from  wikipedia.com  to  wikipedia.org [36] [37] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [38]  Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [39]  A team at the  Palo Alto Research Center  attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [40]  Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \" low-hanging fruit \"\u2014topics that clearly merit an article\u2014have already been created and built up extensively. [41] [42] [43] \nIn November 2009, a researcher at the  Rey Juan Carlos University  in  Madrid  found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [44] [45] The Wall Street Journal  cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [46]  Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology. [47]  Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\". [48]  A 2013  MIT Technology Review  article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. [49]  In July 2012,  The Atlantic  reported that the number of administrators was also in decline. [50]  In the November 25, 2013, issue of  New York  magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\" [51] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline. [52] [53] Milestones Cartogram  showing number of articles in each European language as of January\u00a02019. [update]  One square represents 10,000 articles. Languages with fewer than 10,000 articles are represented by one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color. In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten  most popular websites  in the US, according to  Comscore  Networks. With 42.9\u00a0million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing  The New York Times  (#10) and  Apple  (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3\u00a0million unique visitors. [54]  As of March\u00a02020 [update] , it ranked 13th [4]  in popularity according to  Alexa Internet . In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month. [55]  On February 9, 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia had 18\u00a0billion  page views  and nearly 500\u00a0million  unique visitors  a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\". [10]  Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \" stigmergic  accumulation\". [56] [57] \nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the  United States Congress \u2014the  Stop Online Piracy Act  (SOPA) and the  PROTECT IP Act  (PIPA)\u2014by  blacking out its pages for 24 hours [58]  More than 162\u00a0million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content. [59] [60] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for  The Economic Times  indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\" [61]  Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's  Knowledge Graphs  project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\" [61]  When contacted on this matter,  Clay Shirky , associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's  Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\" [61]  By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally. [62] In January 2013,  274301 Wikipedia , an  asteroid , was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the  Wikipedia Monument ; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as  Print Wikipedia . In April 2019, an Israeli  lunar lander Beresheet , crash landed on the surface of the  Moon  carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. [63] [64]  In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16\u00a0GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into  synthetic DNA [65] Current state Screenshot of  English Wikipedia 's article on  Earth , 30 March 2021 On January 23, 2020, the English-language Wikipedia, which is the largest language section of the online encyclopedia,  published its six millionth article By February 2020, Wikipedia ranked eleventh in the world in terms of Internet traffic. [66]  As a key resource for disseminating information related to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has partnered with Wikipedia to help combat the spread of misinformation. [67] [68] Wikipedia accepts cryptocurrency donations and  Basic Attention Token [69] [70] [71] Openness Differences between versions of an article are highlighted Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the  procrastination  principle [note 3]  regarding the security of its content. [72] Restrictions Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [73]  On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees. [74] [75]  A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it. [76]  A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only  administrators  can make changes. [77]  A 2021 article in the  Columbia Journalism Review  identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"[p]erhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\". [78] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the  German Wikipedia  maintains \"stable versions\" of articles [79]  which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012. [80]  Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [81] Wikipedia's editing interface Review of changes Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision. [note 4] [82]  On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's History page. Anyone can view the  latest changes  to articles, and anyone registered may maintain a  \"watchlist\"  of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [83] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low  transaction costs  of participating in a  wiki  created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\". [84] Vandalism Main article:  Vandalism on Wikipedia Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam. [85]  Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively. [86] American journalist  John Seigenthaler  (1927\u20132014), subject of the  Seigenthaler incident Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. [87] [88]  However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair. [89] In the  Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure  John Seigenthaler  in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the  assassination of John F. Kennedy [89]  It remained uncorrected for four months. [89]  Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of  USA Today  and founder of the  Freedom Forum First Amendment Center  at  Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [90] [91]  After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\". [89]  The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people. [92] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show,  Tosh.0 , to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [93] [94] Edit warring Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\". [95] [96]  It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, [97]  and criticized as creating a competitive [98]  and conflict-based [99]  editing culture associated with traditional masculine  gender roles [100] Policies and laws External video Wikimania 60 Minutes CBS , 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales at  Fosdem Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular,  copyright  laws) of the United States and of the US state of  Virginia , where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the \"five pillars\" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. [101]  Editors can  enforce these rules  by  deleting  or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [79] Content policies and guidelines According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is  encyclopedic  and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. [102]  A topic should also meet  Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\" [103]  which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [104]  It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. [105]  This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced. [106]  Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [107] Governance Further information:  Wikipedia:Administration Wikipedia's initial  anarchy  integrated  democratic  and hierarchical elements over time. [108] [109]  An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. [110] Administrators Editors in good standing in the community can request extra  user rights , granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \" adminship [111] [112]  which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits. [113] [114] By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. [115] Dispute resolution Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, [note 5]  seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n Arbitration Committee Main article:  Arbitration Committee The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [116]  functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). when?  Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and  anti-social behavior . When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [117] Community Main article:  Wikipedia community Play media Video of  Wikimania 2005 \u2014an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the  Wikimedia Foundation , was held in  Frankfurt am Main , Germany, August 4\u20138. Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [118] Play media Wikipedians and  British Museum  curators collaborate on the article  Hoxne Hoard  in June 2010 Wikipedia's community has been described as  cultlike [119]  although not always with entirely negative connotations. [120]  Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of  credentials , has been referred to as \" anti-elitism [121] Wikipedians sometimes award one another \"virtual barnstars\" for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [122] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [123]  As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. [124]  Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community\u00a0... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". [125]  In 2008, a  Slate  magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\" [126]  This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by  Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [127] The English Wikipedia has  6,491,062  articles,  43,474,056  registered editors, and  126,197  active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". [128]  Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, [128]  as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", [129]  but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their  IP addresses  cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n Studies A 2007 study by researchers from  Dartmouth College  found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia\u00a0... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\". [130]  Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\" [125]  However,  Business Insider  editor and journalist  Henry Blodget  showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\". [125] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [131] [132]  although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. [133]  According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\". [134] Diversity Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. [135]  Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including  Yale  and  Brown , gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. [136] Andrew Lih , a professor and scientist, wrote in  The New York Times  that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\". [137]  Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors. [138] Language editions Main article:  List of Wikipedias Distribution of the 58,668,491 articles in different language editions (as of April 28, 2022) [139] English  (11.1%) Cebuano  (10.4%) German  (4.6%) Swedish  (4.4%) French  (4.1%) Dutch  (3.6%) Russian  (3.1%) Spanish  (3%) Italian  (3%) Egyptian Arabic  (2.7%) Polish  (2.6%) Japanese  (2.3%) Vietnamese  (2.2%) Chinese  (2.2%) Waray  (2.2%) Arabic  (2%) Ukrainian  (2%) \u00a0Other (34.5%) Most popular edition of Wikipedia by country in January 2021. Most viewed editions of Wikipedia over time. Most edited editions of Wikipedia over time. There are currently 326 language editions of Wikipedia (also called  language versions , or simply  Wikipedias ). As of April 2022, the six largest, in order of article count, are the  English Cebuano German Swedish French , and  Dutch  Wikipedias. [140]  The second and fourth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating  bot Lsjbot , which as of 2013 [update]  had created about half the articles on the  Swedish Wikipedia , and most of the articles in the  Cebuano  and  Waray Wikipedias . The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\n In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each ( Russian Spanish Italian Egyptian Arabic Polish Japanese Vietnamese Chinese Waray Arabic Ukrainian  and  Portuguese ), seven more have over 500,000 articles ( Persian Catalan Serbian Indonesian Korean Norwegian  and  Finnish ), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000. [141] [140]  The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.4 million articles. As of January\u00a02021, [update]  the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.

A graph for pageviews of  Turkish Wikipedia  shows a large drop of roughly 80% immediately after the  block of Wikipedia in Turkey  was imposed in 2017. Since Wikipedia is based on the  Web  and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the  English edition ). These differences may lead to some conflicts over  spelling differences  (e.g.  colour  versus  color [144]  or points of view. [145] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not  licensed freely  may be used under a claim of  fair use [146] [147] [148] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\". [149]  Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). [150]  For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [151]  and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [152]  The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions [153] Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. [154] A study published by  PLOS One  in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the  English Wikipedia , and 25% for the  simple English Wikipedia [153] English Wikipedia editor numbers Number of editors on the English Wikipedia over time. On March 1, 2014,  The Economist , in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" [155]  The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by  The Economist  as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).  The Economist  reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n In contrast, the trend analysis published in  The Economist  presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. [155]  No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia. [156] Reception See also:  Academic studies about Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2018 Various Wikipedians have  criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [update] [157] [158] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits  systemic bias . In 2010, columnist and journalist  Edwin Black  described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". [159]  Articles in  The Chronicle of Higher Education  and  The Journal of Academic Librarianship  have criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [160] [161] [162] Journalists  Oliver Kamm  and  Edwin Black  alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic. [159] [163]  A 2008 article in  Education Next  Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and  spin [164] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\" [165] In 2022,  John Stossel  opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appears to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics. [166] In 2006, the  Wikipedia Watch  criticism website listed dozens of examples of  plagiarism  in the English Wikipedia. [167] Accuracy of content Main article:  Reliability of Wikipedia External audio The Great Book of Knowledge, Part 1 Ideas with  Paul Kennedy CBC , January 15, 2014 Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. [168]  However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  by the science journal  Nature  found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;  Britannica , about three.\" [169]  Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\" [170]  Others raised similar critiques. [171]  The findings by  Nature  were disputed by  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [172] [173]  and in response,  Nature  gave a rebuttal of the points raised by  Britannica [174]  In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the  Nature  effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in  Nature s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported  confidence intervals ), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small  sample size , 42 or 4 \u00d7 10 1  articles compared, vs >10 5  and >10 6  set sizes for  Britannica  and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [175] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [176]  Concerns have been raised by  PC World  in 2009 regarding the lack of  accountability  that results from users' anonymity, [177]  the insertion of false information, [178] vandalism , and similar problems.\n Economist  Tyler Cowen  wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [179] Amy Bruckman  has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\". [180] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [181]  Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [182]  Editors of traditional  reference works  such as the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  have questioned the project's  utility  and status as an encyclopedia. [183]  Wikipedia co-founder  Jimmy Wales  has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles. [184] External video Inside Wikipedia\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the PR Industry Deutsche Welle , 7:13 mins [185] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for  Internet trolls spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [82] [186] \nIn response to  paid advocacy editing  and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in  The Wall Street Journal , to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [187]  The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.  Katherine Maher , the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia. [187] [188] [189] [190] [191]  These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by  Stephen Colbert  on  The Colbert Report [192] A Harvard law textbook,  Legal Research in a Nutshell  (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\". [193] Discouragement in education This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. December 2020 Most university  lecturers  discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in  academic work , preferring  primary sources [194]  some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [195] [196]  Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [197]  Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten  emails  weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\" he said. [198] In February 2007, an article in  The Harvard Crimson  newspaper reported that a few of the professors at  Harvard University  were including Wikipedia articles in their  syllabi , although without realizing the articles might change. [199]  In June 2007, former president of the  American Library Association Michael Gorman  condemned Wikipedia, along with  Google , stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\". [200] In contrast, academic writing clarification needed  in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process. [201] Medical information See also:  Health information on Wikipedia On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for  The Atlantic  magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\" [202]  Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of  Amin Azzam  at the  University of San Francisco  to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve  Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by  James Heilman  to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. [202]  In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in  The Atlantic  titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\" [203]  Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\" [203] Coverage of topics and systemic bias See also:  Notability in the English Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia \u00a7\u00a0Systemic bias in coverage Parts of this article (those related to  d:Wikidata:Statistics/Wikipedia ) need to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2017 Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has  terabytes  of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [204]  The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see  deletionism and inclusionism [205] [206]  Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of  images of Muhammad  in the  English edition  of its  Muhammad  article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the  censorship of Wikipedia  by national authorities in China [207]  and Pakistan, [208]  amongst other countries.\n Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January\u00a02008 [update] [209] A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [209] Culture and Arts: 30% (210%) Biographies and persons: 15% (97%) Geography and places: 14% (52%) Society and social sciences: 12% (83%) History and events: 11% (143%) Natural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%) Technology and Applied Science: 4% (\u22126%) Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%) Health: 2% (42%) Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%) Thought and Philosophy: 1% (160%) These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the  New York Public Library for the Performing Arts  to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [210] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the  University of Minnesota  indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\". [211] Coverage of topics and selection bias Research conducted by Mark Graham of the  Oxford Internet Institute  in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is the most underrepresented. [212]  Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. [213] An editorial in  The Guardian  in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for  a list of female porn actors  than a  list of women writers [214]  Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in  Cape Town  sought to address. [138] Systemic biases When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics,  systemic bias  may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\". [48]  The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's  Technology Review  titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and  policy creep  on the  downward trend in the number of editors [49] Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, vague  for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions. [215]  It may more specifically follow the biases of  Internet culture , inclining to be young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases, intrinsically, may include an overemphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [215] Taha Yasseri  of the  University of Oxford , in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [216] [217]  His research examined the  counterproductive work behavior  of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the  statistical measurement  of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles  George W. Bush anarchism , and  Muhammad [217]  By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the  Oxford  study were for the articles covering  Croatia Scientology , and  9/11 conspiracy theories [217] Researchers from  Washington University  developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. [218] [219] Explicit content See also:  Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia  and  Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons For the government censorship of Wikipedia, see  Censorship of Wikipedia For Wikipedia's policy concerning censorship, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as  feces cadaver human penis vulva , and  nudity ) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.\n The site also includes  sexual content  such as images and videos of  masturbation  and  ejaculation , illustrations of  zoophilia , and photos from  hardcore pornographic  films in its articles. It also has non-sexual  photographs of nude children The Wikipedia article about  Virgin Killer a 1976 album from the  German rock band Scorpions \u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked  prepubescent  girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article  Virgin Killer  was blocked for four days by most  Internet service providers  in the United Kingdom after the  Internet Watch Foundation  (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers. [220] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on  Wikimedia Commons  contained child pornography, and were in violation of  US federal obscenity law [221] [222]  Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to  pedophilia  and one about  lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the  PROTECT Act of 2003 [223]  That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are  obscene under American law [223]  Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [224] Wikimedia Foundation  spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [225]  saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\" [225]  Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\". [226]  Critics, including  Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [227] Privacy One  privacy  concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \" public figure \" in the eyes of the law. [228] [note 6]  It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in  cyberspace  and the right to be anonymous in  real life meatspace \"). A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.\n In January 2006, a German court ordered the  German Wikipedia  shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of  Boris Floricic , aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's  right to privacy  or that of his parents was being violated. [229] Wikipedia has a \" Volunteer Response Team \" that uses Znuny, a  free and open-source software  fork of  OTRS [230]  to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [231] Sexism Main article:  Gender bias on Wikipedia Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of  sexism  and  harassment [232] [233] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language were reasons put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship. [234] Edit-a-thons  have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. [235] A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, found significant gender differences in: confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\" [236] Operation Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates Main article:  Wikimedia Foundation Katherine Maher  became the third executive director of Wikimedia in 2016, succeeding  Lila Tretikov , who had taken over from  Sue Gardner  in 2014. Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the  Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as  Wiktionary  and  Wikibooks . The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [237]  The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7\u00a0million and expenses of almost $29\u00a0million, with assets of $37.2\u00a0million and liabilities of about $2.3\u00a0million. [238] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named  Lila Tretikov  as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [239]  The  Wall Street Journal  reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\" [240] [241]  The same  Wall Street Journal  article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue ( paid advocacy ) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\" Walsh said. [240] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [242]  Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.\" [243] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called  Wikimedia movement affiliates . These include  Wikimedia chapters  (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikim\u00e9dia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the  Catalan language  community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n Software operations and support See also:  MediaWiki The operation of Wikipedia depends on  MediaWiki , a custom-made,  free  and  open source wiki software  platform written in  PHP  and built upon the  MySQL  database system. [244]  The software incorporates programming features such as a  macro language variables , a  transclusion  system for  templates , and  URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the  GNU General Public License  (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on  UseModWiki  written in  Perl  by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required  CamelCase  for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a  PHP wiki  engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by  Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the  exponentially increasing  demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by  Lee Daniel Crocker Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [245]  to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.\n In April 2005, a  Lucene  extension [246] [247]  was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from  MySQL  to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on  Elasticsearch [248] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension,  VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [249] [250] [251] [252]  It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\". [253]  The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n Automated editing Main article:  Wikipedia bots Computer programs called  bots  have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [254] [255] [256]  One controversial contributor,  Sverker Johansson , creating articles with his  bot  was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [257]  Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). [258]  Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. [255]  Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the  MH17 jet  incident in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. [259]  Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. [260] According to  Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [261] Hardware operations and support See also:  Wikimedia Foundation \u00a7\u00a0Hardware Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day. [262] needs update  As of 2021, [update]  page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of  Varnish  caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by  Apache Traffic Server [263]  Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [264]  Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the  Linux Virtual Server  software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. [265] Overview of system architecture as of April\u00a02020 [update] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated  clusters  of  Linux  servers with  Debian [266]  As of December\u00a02009, [update]  there were 300 in Florida and 44 in  Amsterdam [267]  By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an  Equinix  facility in  Ashburn, Virginia [268] [269]  In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in  Singapore , the first of its kind in Asia. [270] Internal research and operational development Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [49]  the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of  industrial organization  economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [271]  Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized \"Thank\" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [49] [253]  The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [272]  At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45\u00a0million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8\u00a0million and 11.3\u00a0million dollars annually. [272]  In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by  Bloomberg News  as being at $77\u00a0million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08\u00a0million and $19.2\u00a0million annually. [272] Internal news publications Community-produced news publications include the  English Wikipedia 's  The Signpost , founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator, and former chair of the  Wikimedia Foundation  board of trustees. [273]  It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other  Wikimedia projects , such as  Wikimedia Commons . Similar publications are the German-language  Kurier , and the Portuguese-language  Correio da Wikip\u00e9dia . Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the  Wikiworld  webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like  The Bugle  from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also several publications from the  Wikimedia Foundation  and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff and  This Month in Education The Wikipedia Library For information for Wikipedia editors, see  Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of  digital publications , so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. [274] [275]  Over  60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when  ICE Publishing  joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources \u2013 creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\" [276] Access to content Content licensing When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the  GNU Free Documentation License  (GFDL), a  copyleft  license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [277]  The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with  free software  programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the  Creative Commons license  was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [278]  Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the  Free Software Foundation  (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to  relicense its content to CC BY-SA  by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [279] [280] [281] [282] The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under  fair use  doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in  Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by  free content  licenses (e.g.  Creative Commons ' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via  Wikimedia Commons  repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [283] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [284] [285] Methods of access Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\n Websites : Thousands of \" mirror sites \" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are  Reference.com  and  Answers.com . Another example is  Wapedia , which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Mobile apps : A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on  hand-held devices , including both  Android  and  iOS  devices (see  Wikipedia apps ). (see also  Mobile access Search engines : Some web  search engines  make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include  Microsoft Bing  (via technology gained from  Powerset [286]  and  DuckDuckGo Compact discs, DVDs : Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on  optical discs . An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles. [287] [288]  The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles. [289]  There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well. [290] [291]  Also, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and  SOS Children , is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the  UK National Curriculum  and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world. [292]  The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes. Printed books : There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. [293] [294]  Since 2009, tens of thousands of  print-on-demand  books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company  Books LLC  and by three  Mauritian  subsidiaries of the German publisher  VDM [295] Semantic Web : The website  DBpedia , begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the  Wikidata  project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable  semantic  format,  RDF . As of April\u00a02021, [update]  it has 93,337,731 items. Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a  web crawler  is discouraged. [296]  Wikipedia publishes  \"dumps\"  of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 [update]  there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [297] Wikimedia Enterprise  is a for-profit solution to this.\n Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the  Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library  reference desk , with an accuracy of 55 percent. [298] Mobile access See also:  Help:Mobile access The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page, from August 3, 2019 Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard  web browser  through a fixed  Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the  mobile web  since July 2013,  The New York Times  on February 9, 2014, quoted  Erik M\u00f6ller , deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [10]  The article in  The New York Times  reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" [10] The New York Times  reports that M\u00f6ller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by  The New York Times  for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [10] Bloomberg Businessweek  reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. [299]  At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with  Sue Gardner  in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [241]  The  Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [300]  The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [301]  Later versions have also been released.\n Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the  Wireless Application Protocol  (WAP), via the  Wapedia  service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, [302]  located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the  iPhone Android -based devices or  WebOS -based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia  metadata , such as  geoinformation [303] [304] Wikipedia Zero  was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. [305]  It was discontinued in February 2018. [306] Andrew Lih  and  Andrew Brown  both maintain editing Wikipedia with  smartphones  is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of  MIT Technology Review  claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some  Wikipedians  use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the  status quo [49]  Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it. [307] [308] Chinese access Access to the  Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked  in  mainland China  since May 2015. [309] [310] [311]  This was done after Wikipedia started to use  HTTPS  encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult. [312] In 2017,  Quartz  reported that the Chinese government had begun creating an unofficial version of Wikipedia. However, unlike Wikipedia, the website's contents would only be editable by scholars from state-owned Chinese institutions. The article stated it had been approved by the  State Council of the People's Republic of China  in 2011. [313] Cultural impact Trusted source to combat fake news In 2017\u201318, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.  Noam Cohen , writing in  The Washington Post  states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out ' fake news [15]  As of November\u00a02020, [update]  Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.03 and the average daily time on site as 3:46 minutes. [4] Readership In February 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\" [10]  However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. [314] In addition to  logistic growth  in the number of its articles, [315]  Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [316]  About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, [317]  a good portion of which is related to academic research. [318]  The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365\u00a0million at the end of 2009. [319]  The  Pew  Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [320]  In 2011  Business Insider  gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4\u00a0billion if it ran advertisements. [321] According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [322] COVID-19 pandemic Main article:  Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic During the  COVID-19 pandemic , Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. [323] Cultural significance \"Wikipedia in webcomics\" redirects here. For the list of Wikipedia's appearances in webcomics, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia in webcomics Main article:  Wikipedia in culture Wikipedia Monument  in  S\u0142ubice , Poland (2014, by  Mihran Hakobyan Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [324] [325] [326]  The  Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on  same-sex marriage  in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the  Civil Marriage Act [327]  The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the  World Intellectual Property Organization [328] \u2014though mainly for  supporting information  rather than information decisive to a case. [329]  Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some  US intelligence agency  reports. [330]  In December 2008, the scientific journal  RNA Biology  launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the  RNA family  for publication in Wikipedia. [331] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [332] [333]  often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for  plagiarizing from Wikipedia [334] [335] [336] In 2006,  Time  magazine  recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with  YouTube Reddit MySpace , and  Facebook [337]  in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.\n In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on  BBC Radio 4 [338]  which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select group of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ( Google Facebook YouTube ) that they no longer need explanation.\n On September 28, 2007,  Italian  politician  Franco Grillini  raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of  freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [339] Play media Wikipedia, an introduction \u2013  Erasmus Prize  2015 Jimmy Wales  accepts the 2008  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award on behalf of Wikipedia On September 16, 2007,  The Washington Post  reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the  2008 US election campaign , saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\" [340]  An October 2007  Reuters  article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [341] Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. [342] A working group led by  Peter Stone  (formed as a part of the  Stanford -based project  One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence ) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\" [343] In a 2017 opinion piece for  Wired Hossein Derakhshan  describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the  open  and  decentralized web \" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with  social media  and  social networking services , the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the  Age of Enlightenment  tradition of  rationality  triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a  typographic  culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \" sapere aude lit. ''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of \"[d]are not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television\u2014how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\" [344] Awards Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [345]  The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual  Prix Ars Electronica  contest; this came with a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in  Austria  later that year. The second was a Judges'  Webby Award  for the \"community\" category. [346] In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\" [347] In September 2008, Wikipedia received  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with  Boris Tadi\u0107 Eckart H\u00f6fling , and  Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by  David Weinberger [348] In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual  Erasmus Prize , which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, [349]  and the  Spanish Princess of Asturias Award  on International Cooperation. [350]  Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony,  Jimmy Wales  praised the work of the  Asturian language  Wikipedia users. [351] Satire See also:  Category:Parodies of Wikipedia Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\n Comedian  Stephen Colbert  has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show  The Colbert Report  and coined the related term  wikiality , meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on\u2014the reality we just agreed on\". [192]  Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in  The Onion [352]  as well as the 2010  The Onion  article \"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\". [353] In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy  The Office , office manager ( Michael Scott ) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on  negotiation  tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [354]  Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. [355] My Number One Doctor \", a 2007 episode of the television show  Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which  Perry Cox  reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the  raw food diet  reverses the effects of  bone cancer  by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the  Battlestar Galactica  episode guide [356] In 2008, the comedy website  CollegeHumor  produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [357] The  Dilbert  comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\" [358] In July 2009,  BBC Radio 4  broadcast a comedy series called  Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [359] On August 23, 2013, the  New Yorker  website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit,  Manning , have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\" [360]  The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a  trans woman In December 2015,  John Julius Norwich  stated, in a letter published in  The Times  newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [361] [362] Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia Main article:  Wikimedia project Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the  Wikimedia Foundation . These other  Wikimedia projects  include  Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [363] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,  Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,  Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,  Wikinews , for citizen journalism, and  Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [364]  Another sister project of Wikipedia,  Wikispecies , is a catalogue of species. In 2012  Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, and  Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched.\n Publishing A group of Wikimedians of the  Wikimedia DC  chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (back left)  at the US National Archives The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g.  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [365] [366] [367] Nicholas Carr  wrote a 2005 essay, \"The amorality of  Web 2.0 \", that criticized websites with  user-generated content , like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote: \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\" [368]  Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance,  Chris Anderson , the editor-in-chief of  Wired Magazine , wrote in  Nature  that the \" wisdom of crowds \" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top  scientific journals , with their rigorous  peer review  process. [369] There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" said  Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of  The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton  and  George Eliot: the Last Victorian [370] Research use Wikipedia has been widely used as a  corpus  for linguistic research in  computational linguistics information retrieval  and  natural language processing . In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the  entity linking  problem, which is then called \"wikification\", [371]  and to the related problem of  word-sense disambiguation [372]  Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia. [373] In 2015, French researchers Jos\u00e9 Lages of the  University of Franche-Comt\u00e9  in  Besan\u00e7on  and Dima Shepelyansky of  Paul Sabatier University  in  Toulouse  published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. [374] [375] [376]  They used  PageRank CheiRank  and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\". [376] [377]  The study was updated in 2019. [378] A 2017  MIT  study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. [379] [380] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using  machine learning  and  artificial intelligence  to support various operations. One of the most important areas\u2014automatic detection of vandalism [381] [382]  and  data quality  assessment in Wikipedia. [383] In February 2022,  civil servants  from the UK's  Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities  were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the  Levelling Up White Paper  after journalists at  The Independent  noted that parts of the  document  had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on  Constantinople  and the  list of largest cities throughout history [384] Related projects Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986  BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on  BBC Micro  computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [385] Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.  Everything2 [386]  with many later being merged into the project (e.g.  GNE [387]  One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was  h2g2 , which was created by  Douglas Adams  in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n Subsequent collaborative  knowledge  websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia.  Some, such as  Susning.nu Enciclopedia Libre Hudong , and  Baidu Baike  likewise employ no formal review process, although some like  Conservapedia  are not as open. citation needed  Others use more traditional  peer review , such as  Encyclopedia of Life  and the online wiki encyclopedias  Scholarpedia  and  Citizendium . The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

Retrieved  March 26,  2021 There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

This page is for documenting and explaining the English Wikipedia  policy  on page protection. Are you trying to request protection of a page?  Request page protection Are you trying to request removal of a page's protection?  Request a change in page protection level Do you want to request an edit be made to a protected page?  Create an edit request Do you need to report persistent vandalism or spam to an  administrator File a vandalism report Do you need to report an inappropriate username or an account with a username that blatantly violates Wikipedia's  username policy File a username report Are you currently blocked from editing Wikipedia and wish to request an unblock? You can resolve this matter by  appealing your block Do you need to report an  edit war  or  three-revert rule  violation to an administrator?  File an edit war report Do you need to report or discuss a policy violation or behavioral issue (such as an evasion of a  block , abuse of tools, or other incidents) on Wikipedia that requires administrator intervention?

Pages are protected when a specific damaging event has been identified that can not be prevented through other means such as a  block . Otherwise, Wikipedia is built on the principle that  anyone can edit it , and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. This policy states in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and when each protection should and should not be applied.\n Protection is a technical restriction applied only by  administrators , although any user may  request protection . Protection can be  indefinite  or expire after a specified time. The various levels of protection are detailed below, and they can be applied to the page edit, page move, page create, and file upload actions. Even when a page is protected from editing, the  source code wikitext ) of the page can still be viewed and copied by anyone.\n A protected page is marked at its top right by a padlock icon, usually added by the  pp-protected  template.\n Contents 1 Types of protection 1.1 Full protection 1.1.1 Content disputes 1.1.2 Vandalism 1.1.3 \"History only\" review 1.1.4 Protected generic file names 1.1.5 Permanent protection 1.2 Template protection 1.3 Semi-protection 1.3.1 Guidance for administrators 1.4 Creation protection (salting) 1.5 Move protection 1.6 Upload protection 1.7 Pending changes protection 1.7.1 When to apply pending changes protection 1.8 Extended confirmed protection 1.9 Office actions 1.10 Cascading protection 2 Former deleted protections 2.1 Superprotect 2.2 Cascading semi-protection 2.3 Pending changes protection level\u00a02 3 Protection by namespace 3.1 Article talk pages 3.2 User talk pages 3.2.1 Blocked users 3.3 User pages 3.3.1 Deceased users 3.4 Protection of templates 3.5 Sandboxes 4 Available templates 5 See also 6 Notes Types of protection Shortcut WP:PPLIST The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages:\n Edit protection  protects the page from being  edited Move protection  protects the page from being  moved or renamed Creation protection  prevents a page (normally a previously  deleted  one) from being created (also known as \" salting Upload protection  prevents new versions of a file from being  uploaded , but it does not prevent editing to the file's description page (unless edit protection is applied). The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages:\n Pending changes protection (only available for edit protection)  means edits by unregistered and new editors are not visible to readers who are not logged-in until the edits are approved by a  reviewer  or an administrator. Semi-protection  prevents the action by unregistered editors and editors with accounts that are not  confirmed Extended confirmed protection , also known as  30/500 protection , prevents the action by users without 30 days' tenure and 500 edits on the English Wikipedia. In most cases it should not be a protection level of first resort, and should be used where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. Its use is logged at the  Administrators' noticeboard Template protection  prevents the action by everyone except  template editors  and  administrators  (who have this right as part of their toolset). Full protection  prevents the action by everyone except  administrators Any type of protection (with the exception of  cascading protection ) may be requested at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection . Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding  talk page , then carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or there is  consensus  for them.\n Except in the case of  office actions  (see  below Arbitration Committee  remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace (see  below ), administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary. Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at  Requests for unprotection . Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first. A log of protections and unprotections is available at  Special:Log/protect Interaction of Wikipedia user groups and page protection levels\n Unregistered  or  Newly registered Confirmed  or  Auto-confirmed Extended confirmed Template editor Admin Interface admin Appropriate for\n No protection\n normal editing The vast majority of pages. (This is the default protection level.)\n Pending changes protection all users can edit. Edits by  unregistered or new editors  (and any subsequent edits by  anyone ) are hidden from readers who are not logged in, until reviewed by a  pending changes reviewer  or  admin . Logged-in editors see all edits, whether accepted or not.\n Infrequently edited pages with high levels of vandalism,  BLP  violations, edit-warring, or other disruption from unregistered and new users\n Semi-protection cannot edit normal editing Pages that are frequently edited by anonymous and registered users; some highly visible templates & modules\n Extended- confirmed prot. cannot edit normal editing Specific topic areas authorized by  ArbCom ; pages where semi-protection has failed;  high-risk templates  where template protection would be too restrictive\n Template prot. cannot edit normal editing High-risk  or very frequently used templates & modules; also  some  high-risk pages outside  template space Full protection cannot edit normal editing Articles with persistent disruption from extended confirmed accounts; critical templates & modules\n Interface protection cannot edit normal editing Scripts, stylesheets, and similar objects central to operation of the site\n  In order to edit through extended confirmed protection, a template editor must also be extended confirmed, but in practice this is essentially always the case.\n Other modes of protection:\n Create protection Move protection Upload protection Office protection Cascade protection view talk edit Full protection Shortcuts WP:FULL WP:GOLDLOCK A fully protected page cannot be edited or moved by anyone except  administrators . The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.\n Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit fully-protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Content disputes See also:  Wikipedia:Stable version \"WP:PREFER\" redirects here. For what title name should be preferred, see  Wikipedia:Disambiguation \u00a7\u00a0Primary topic While content disputes and  edit warring  may be addressed with user  blocks  issued by  uninvolved  administrators, allowing normal page editing by other editors at the same time, the protection policy provides an alternative approach as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war. This approach may better suit multi-party disputes and contentious content, as it makes talk page  consensus  a requirement for implementation of  requested edits Shortcut WP:PREFER When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as  vandalism copyright violations defamation , or  poor-quality coverage of living people . Administrators are deemed to remain uninvolved when exercising discretion on whether to apply protection to the current version of an article, or to an older,  stable , or pre-edit-war version.\n Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version  prior to  the edit war and  request  reversion to that version. Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.\n Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered  involved  and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions. When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.\n Vandalism Shortcuts WP:NO-PREEMPT WP:PREEMPTIVE Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons. However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring by multiple users and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.\n \"History only\" review Shortcut WP:PPDRV If a deleted page is going through  deletion review , only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page. If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may  restore  the page, blank it or replace the contents with  Temporarily undeleted  template or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing. The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the  page history  Protected generic file names Generic file names such as  File:Photo.jpg File:Map.jpg , and  File:Sound.wav  are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded. Furthermore,  File:Map.jpg  and  File:Sound.wav  are  salted Permanent protection Shortcuts WP:PPINDEF WP:REDLOCK Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia, which are permanently protected by the  MediaWiki  software:\n Edits to the  MediaWiki namespace , which defines parts of the site interface, are restricted to administrators.\n Edits to system-wide CSS and JavaScript pages such as  MediaWiki:common.js  are further restricted to  interface administrators Edits to personal CSS and JavaScript pages such as  User:Example/monobook.css  and  User:Example/cologneblue.js  are restricted to the associated user and interface administrators. Interface administrators may edit these pages, for example, to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way. Administrators may delete (but not edit or restore) these pages. Edits to personal JSON pages such as  User:Example/data.json  are restricted to the associated user and administrators. Such protection is called Permanent, Interface, or Indefinite protection; and pages so protected can only be edited by those with  Interface Administrator rights In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually fully protected for an indefinite period of time (though not necessarily with Interface protection):\n Pages that are very visible, such as the  Main Page Pages that should not be modified for copyright or legal reasons, such as the  general disclaimer  or the  local copy of the site copyright license Pages that are very frequently  transcluded , such as  tl  or  citation needed , to prevent  vandalism  or  denial of service  attacks. This includes images or templates used in other highly visible or frequently transcluded pages. See  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  for more information. Template protection Main page:  Wikipedia:Template editor Shortcuts WP:TPROT WP:PINKLOCK A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the Template editors group. This protection level should be used almost exclusively on  high-risk templates  and  modules . In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.\n This is a protection level [1]  that replaces  full protection  on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes. It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection. It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the  template editor  user right exists\u2014the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community. In borderline cases,  extended confirmed protection  or lower may be applied to high risk templates that the general editing community still needs to edit regularly.\n Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit template-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Semi-protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection Shortcuts WP:SEMI WP:SILVERLOCK Semi-protected pages cannot be edited by  unregistered users IP addresses ), as well as accounts that are not  autoconfirmed  (accounts that are at least four days old and have made at least ten edits to Wikipedia) or  confirmed . Semi-protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or  vandalism  from new or unregistered users, or to prevent  sockpuppets  of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on  biographies of living persons  who have had a recent high level of media interest. An alternative to semi-protection is  pending changes , which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.\n Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{ Edit semi-protected }} template if necessary to gain attention. If the page in question and its talk page are  both  protected, please make your edit request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection  instead. New users may also request the confirmed user right at  Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed Guidance for administrators Administrators may apply  indefinite  semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent  vandalism  or violations of  content policy  (such as  biographies of living persons neutral point of view ). Semi-protection should  not  be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred or to privilege registered users over unregistered users in (valid) content disputes.\n In addition, administrators may apply  temporary  semi-protection on pages that are:\n Subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to  media attention ) if  blocking  individual users is not a feasible option. Subject to  edit warring  if  all  parties involved are unregistered or new editors (i.e. in cases in which full protection would otherwise be applied). This does  not  apply when autoconfirmed users are involved. Subject to  vandalism  or  edit warring  where unregistered editors are engaging in  IP hopping  by using different computers, obtaining new addresses by using  dynamic IP  allocation, or other address-changing schemes. Article discussion pages, if they have been subject to persistent disruption. Such protection should be used sparingly because it prevents unregistered and newly registered users from participating in discussions. A page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time. If a page and its talk page are both protected, the talk page should direct affected editors to  Wikipedia:Request for edit  to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing. Protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users, including IP addresses. Instead the user should be re-blocked with talk page editing disallowed. When required, or when re-blocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful, protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block. Today's featured article  may be semi-protected just like any other article. But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances. For the former guideline, see  Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection Creation protection (salting) Shortcuts WP:SALT WP:SKYBLUELOCK Administrators can prevent the creation of pages. This level of protection is useful for pages that have been  deleted  but repeatedly recreated. Such protection is case-sensitive. There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection. A list of protected titles may be found at  Special:ProtectedTitles  (see also  historical lists Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the  title blacklist  system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for  substrings  and  regular expressions Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as \" salted \". Editors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an  administrator  (preferably the protecting administrator), file a request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection#Current requests for reduction in protection level , or use the  deletion review  process. To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a  draft version  of the intended article when filing a request.\n Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection\u2014autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, [2]  or full. Due to the implementation of  ACPERM , non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in  mainspace ; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.\n While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user (or  sockpuppets  of that user, if applicable).\n Move protection Shortcuts WP:MOVP WP:GREENLOCK Move-protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator. Move protection is commonly applied to:\n Pages subject to persistent page-move  vandalism Pages subject to a page-name dispute. Highly visible pages that have no reason to be moved, such as the  administrators' noticeboard  and articles selected as \" Today's featured article \" on the main page. Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.\n As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring  should not be considered an endorsement of the current name . When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.\n All  files  are implicitly move-protected; only  file movers  and administrators can rename files.\n Upload protection Shortcuts WP:UPLOAD-P WP:PURPLELOCK Upload-protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator. Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing. It may be applied by an administrator to:\n Files subject to persistent upload  vandalism Files subject to a dispute between editors. Files that should not be replaced, such as images used in the interface or transcluded to the main page. Files with common or generic names. (e.g.,  File:Map.png As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current version. An exception to this rule is when they are protected due to upload vandalism.\n Pending changes protection Further information:  Wikipedia:Pending changes Shortcuts WP:PCPP WP:WHITELOCK Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress  vandalism  and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits. Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi-protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from most readers until those changes are accepted by a  pending changes reviewer When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  unregistered  (IP addresses) editor or a  new user , the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the  pending changes reviewer right . When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  autoconfirmed user , the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers, unless there are pending edits waiting to be reviewed.\n Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review. Readers that are  not logged in  (the vast majority of readers) are shown the latest  accepted  version of the page;  logged-in  users see the latest version of the page, with all changes (reviewed or not) applied. When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.\n A user who clicks \"edit this page\" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing  regardless of whether the user is logged in or not If the editor is not logged in, their changes join any other changes to the article awaiting review\u00a0\u2013 for the present they remain hidden from not-logged-in users. (This means that when the editor looks at the article after saving, the editor won't see the change made.) If the editor is logged in and a pending changes reviewer, and there are pending changes, the editor will be prompted to review the pending changes before editing\u00a0\u2013 see  Wikipedia:Pending changes If the editor is logged in and not a pending changes reviewer, then If there are no unreviewed pending edits waiting, this editor's edits will be visible to everyone immediately; but If there are unreviewed pending edits waiting, then this editor's edits will be visible only to other logged-in users (including themself) immediately, but not to readers not logged in. Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.\n When to apply pending changes protection Pending changes may be used to protect articles against:\n Persistent vandalism Violations of the  biographies of living persons  policy Copyright violations Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. Like semi-protection, PC protection should  never  be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Instead, semi-protection should be considered.\n In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.\n Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at  requests for unprotection The reviewing process is described in detail at  Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes Extended confirmed protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to extended confirmed protection Shortcuts WP:ECP WP:BLUELOCK Extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, only allows edits by editors with the  extended confirmed  user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days' tenure and 500 edits.\n Where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption (such as  vandalism , abusive  sockpuppetry edit wars , etc.) on any topic. Extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered/new users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by Arbitration Committee 30/500 rulings. Extended confirmed protection may be applied at the discretion of an administrator when creation-protecting a page. [2] High-risk templates  may be extended-confirmed protected at administrator discretion when template protection would be too restrictive and semi-protection would be ineffective to stop widespread disruption. [3] Until August 12, 2016, [4]  30/500 protection applied only in topic areas determined by the  Arbitration Committee , which authorized its use on articles reasonably construed as belonging to the  Arab\u2013Israeli conflict [5]  as an arbitration enforcement tool by motion or remedy; [6]  or as a result of community consensus. [7]  In February 2019, the community authorized uninvolved administrators to place pages reasonably construed as belonging to the  India\u2013Pakistan conflict  under extended confirmed protection as part of a general sanctions regime. [8]  In May 2020 the Arbitration Committee authorized extended confirmed protection to pages related to the history of Jews and  antisemitism in Poland  during World War II (1933\u20131945). [9] As of September 23, 2016, a bot posts a notification in a subsection of  AN  when this protection level is used. [10]  Any protection made as arbitration enforcement must be logged at  Wikipedia:Arbitration enforcement log . A full list of the 3709 pages under 30/500 protection can be found  here Users can request edits to an extended confirmed-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit extended-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Office actions See also:  Wikipedia:Office actions Shortcuts WP:WMF-PRO WP:BLACKLOCK As outlined in  Meta-Wiki:Office actions#Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff , pages may be protected by  Wikimedia Foundation  staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel.  Such actions override community consensus . Administrators should  not  edit or unprotect such pages without permission from Wikimedia Foundation staff. [11] Cascading protection \"WP:CASCADE\" redirects here. You may also be looking for  Help:Cascading Style Sheets  or  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items Shortcuts WP:CASCADE WP:TURQUOISELOCK Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection  automatically  to any page that is  transcluded  onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly. This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia. Files stored on Commons are  not  protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and, if they are to be protected, must be either temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or explicitly protected at Commons (whether manually or through cascading protection there). When operational,  KrinkleBot  cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection  and  Main Page . As the bot's response time varies, media should  not  be transcluded on the main page (or its constituent templates) until after it has been protected. (This is particularly relevant to  Template:In the news , for which upcoming images are not queued at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow .) Cascading protection:\n Should be used only to prevent  vandalism  when placed on particularly visible pages, such as the main page. Is available only for fully protected pages; it is disabled for lower levels of protection as it represents a workflow flaw. See  below  as well as  this bug ticket  for more information. Is not instantaneous; it may be several hours before it takes effect. See  Phabricator:T20483  for more information. Should generally not be applied directly to templates or  modules , as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the  documentation subpage See  \u00a7\u00a0Protection of templates  below , for alternatives. The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items . Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at  Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items  as an  edit request Former deleted protections Superprotect Shortcut WP:SUPERPROTECT See also:  Meta-Wiki:Superprotect Superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by  Wikimedia Foundation employees who are in the Staff global group . It was  implemented on August 10, 2014  and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the  German Wikipedia 's primary site JavaScript,  common.js . It was never used on the English Wikipedia. On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to  remove  superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.\n Cascading semi-protection Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after  users noticed  that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.\n Pending changes protection level\u00a02 Shortcut WP:ORANGELOCK Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not  pending changes reviewers  to be reviewed. Following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017. It was suggested then that \"Pending changes level 1\" be referred to in the future as simply \"Pending changes\". [12] Protection by namespace Shortcut WP:PROTNS Article talk pages Shortcut WP:ATPROT \nModifications to a protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.\n User talk pages Shortcut WP:UTPROT User talk pages are rarely protected. However, protection may be applied if there is severe vandalism or abuse. Users whose talk pages are protected may wish to have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from users that the protection restricts editing from.\n A user's request to have their own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.\n Blocked users Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.\n In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{ unblock }} template, re-blocking the user with talk page access removed should be preferred over applying protection to the page. If the user has been blocked and with the ability to edit their user talk page disabled, they should be informed of this in a block notice, subsequent notice, or message, and it should include information and instructions for appealing their block off-wiki, such as through the  UTRS tool interface  or, as a last recourse,  the Arbitration Committee When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.\n Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with  Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry ; their pages are not normally protected.\n User pages Shortcuts WP:UPROT WP:UPPROT Base user pages (for example, the page User:Example, and not User:Example/subpage or User talk:Example) are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed accounts and anonymous IP users. An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered account attempting to create or edit their own user page. IP editors and unconfirmed accounts are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a currently-registered account. This protection is enforced by  an edit filter [13]  Users may opt-out of this protection by placing  unlocked userpage  anywhere on their own user page.\n User pages  and subpages within their own user space may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists. Pages within the user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected without good reason or cause. [14] [15]  Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.\n When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a \".css\" subpage (ex. User:Example/Userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting  {{User:Example/Userpage.css}}  on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. Because user space pages that end in \".css\", \".js\", and \".json\" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.\n Deceased users See also:  Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.\n Protection of templates Shortcut WP:PTPROT See also:  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  and  Wikipedia:Template documentation Highly visible templates\u00a0\u2013 those used on a large number of pages or frequently substituted\u00a0\u2013 are often edit protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, and other considerations.\n Protected templates should normally have the {{ documentation }} template. It loads the unprotected  /doc  page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. It also automatically adds {{ pp-template }} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. Only manually add  {{pp-template}}  to protected templates that don't use  {{documentation}}  (mostly the flag templates).\n Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the template's  documentation subpage . Instead, consider any of the following:\n If the set of subtemplates is static (even if large), protect them using normal protection mechanisms. If the set of subtemplates is unbounded, use  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist  to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format (as is done for  editnotice templates  and subtemplates of  Template:TFA title Note: All  editnotice templates  (except those in userspace) are already protected via  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist .

Please read up on the  protection policy . Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to  high-risk templates ; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the  rough guide to semi-protection ); and move protection is used to stop  pagemove  revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the  rough guide to extended confirmed protection After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on  Special:Protectedpages . Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of  obvious vandalism Note : Editors should  not  consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content.

It has been barred from editing for almost 11 years. I made a case on the talk page, which I will copy here.\nI am requesting recreation as Lucifer Valentine has received significant media attention since this page was locked in 2011. He has made many new movies, committed crimes, and been given awards. Additionally, with the way this is set up, we would have to make several pages for each individual movie that all include information on him, rather than have 1 page that discusses him connected to the several movie pages. He was also in a documentary called  Beyond Horror: The History and Sub-Culture of Red Films  in 2019 which means he meets notability guidelines. He's also mentioned  here here  and  here  . If he's notable enough to have a Fandago page and sell his 2015 movie (not in the Vomit Dolls triology) at Booksamillion, I'm sure he is notable enough for Wikipedia. He also has over 19 film credits now. \nLucifer Valentine is a widely discussed topic on social media, has several film nominations, has been featured in documentaries, and there is extensive content on him Wikipedia would be able to cover. This would make it much more user-friendly for all of his movie pages and provide reliable information on a highly sought after topic. Perhaps he was not as notable in 2011 when this page was locked, but there is a case to be made for his notability now.  CherriGasoline talk ) 04:16, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply ReaderofthePack : Pinging the protecting administrator ReaderofthePack.  Malcolmxl5 talk ) 11:08, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply I don't mind, but I highly suggest making a draft first and making sure that he passes notability guidelines. Keep in mind that having a Fandango page doesn't necessarily mean that someone is notable. Also, part of the issue here was that he was predominantly known for his Vomit Dolls trilogy, so the big emphasis here would be showing how he's notable for more than just that series. There are some  self-published sources  like blogs and so on that cover him, but coverage in places that Wikipedia would see as both reliable and notability giving are pretty slim. Some tend to focus on the Vomit Dolls trilogy or discuss his films as part of one ongoing series. Now that said, I do see coverage  here  and  here , as well as at  Ginger Nuts of Horror , which is good. But again, you need to establish how he's notable apart from his Vomit Dolls work. I highly recommend creating a draft before moving anything live and getting one of us to look it over - I don't mind taking a look. The page was deleted in the past so there's more chance that someone will try to renominate it unless it passes notability guidelines per  WP:NBIO  and has strong sourcing. There's a brochure on creating biography articles  here  that would definitely help with that.  ReaderofthePack (formerly Tokyogirl79)  12:16, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply Also, please read over  WP:NCRIME  - given this aspect I'd like to see a draft before unprotecting the page. You can create one at  WP:AfC ReaderofthePack (formerly Tokyogirl79)  12:17, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply CherriGasoline . ReaderofthePack has given you advice, essentially to create a draft of your proposed article - you can use  WP:AFC  for this. Can we close this now?

Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes them difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail in flight. The preferred habitat is dry, open country with some trees and small bushes. The breeding male has a churring trill, and patrols his  territory  with wings held in a V-shape. The female lays two eggs directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17\u201321 days and the chicks  fledge  in another 16\u201317 days. Both \" Caprimulgus \" and the old name \"goatsucker\" refer to the myth that nightjars suckled she-goats, causing them to cease to give milk. Its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classed by the  IUCN  as being of  least concern Full\u00a0article... \nRecently featured:  Battle of Oroscopa Paige Bueckers Uro\u0161 Drenovi\u0107 Archive By email More featured articles Did you know\u00a0...

Individual contributors, also called editors, are known as  Wikipedians . Wikipedia is the largest and most-read  reference work  in history. [3]  It is consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by  Alexa ; as of 2022, [update]  Wikipedia was ranked the 10th most popular site. [3] [4]  It is hosted by the  Wikimedia Foundation , an  American non-profit organization  funded mainly through donations. [5] On January 15, 2001,  Jimmy Wales [6]  and  Larry Sanger  launched Wikipedia; Sanger coined its name as a  portmanteau  of \"wiki\" and \"encyclopedia.\" [7] [8]  Wales was influenced by the \" spontaneous order \" ideas associated with  Friedrich Hayek  and the  Austrian School  of economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and  Mises Institute  Senior Fellow  Mark Thornton [9]  Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 58 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per second) as of November\u00a02020 [update] [10] [11]  In 2006,  Time  magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the \"biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world.\" [6] Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the  democratization of knowledge , extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but  criticism  for exhibiting  systemic bias , particularly  gender bias  against women and alleged  ideological bias [12] [13] Its reliability  was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over time; it has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. [3] [12] [14]  Its coverage of controversial topics  such as American politics  and major events  such as the COVID-19 pandemic  has received substantial media attention. It has  been censored by world governments , ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Nevertheless, it has  become an element of popular culture , with references in  books films , and  academic studies . In April 2018,  Facebook  and  YouTube  announced that they would help users detect  fake news  by suggesting  fact-checking links to related Wikipedia articles [15] [16] Contents 1 History 1.1 Nupedia 1.2 Launch and growth 1.3 Milestones 2 Current state 3 Openness 3.1 Restrictions 3.2 Review of changes 3.3 Vandalism 3.4 Edit warring 4 Policies and laws 4.1 Content policies and guidelines 5 Governance 5.1 Administrators 5.2 Dispute resolution 5.2.1 Arbitration Committee 6 Community 6.1 Studies 6.2 Diversity 7 Language editions 7.1 English Wikipedia editor numbers 8 Reception 8.1 Accuracy of content 8.2 Discouragement in education 8.2.1 Medical information 8.3 Coverage of topics and systemic bias 8.3.1 Coverage of topics and selection bias 8.3.2 Systemic biases 8.4 Explicit content 8.5 Privacy 8.6 Sexism 9 Operation 9.1 Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates 9.2 Software operations and support 9.3 Automated editing 9.4 Hardware operations and support 9.5 Internal research and operational development 9.6 Internal news publications 9.7 The Wikipedia Library 10 Access to content 10.1 Content licensing 10.2 Methods of access 10.2.1 Mobile access 10.3 Chinese access 11 Cultural impact 11.1 Trusted source to combat fake news 11.2 Readership 11.2.1 COVID-19 pandemic 11.3 Cultural significance 11.3.1 Awards 11.3.2 Satire 11.4 Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia 11.5 Publishing 11.6 Research use 12 Related projects 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 Further reading 16.1 Academic studies 16.2 Books 16.3 Book review-related articles 16.4 Learning resources 16.5 Other media coverage 16.5.1 General articles 16.5.2 Articles re Wikipedia usage patterns 17 External links History Main article:  History of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger Nupedia Main article:  Nupedia Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called  Nupedia Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful. [17]  Wikipedia began as a complementary project for  Nupedia , a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. [18]  It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of  Bomis , a  web portal  company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO  Jimmy Wales  and  Larry Sanger editor-in-chief  for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. [1] [19]  Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia  Open Content  License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the  GNU Free Documentation License  at the urging of  Richard Stallman [20]  Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [21] [22]  while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a  wiki  to reach that goal. [23]  On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. [24] Launch and growth The  domains wikipedia.com  (later redirecting to  wikipedia.org ) and  wikipedia.org  were registered on January 12, 2001, [25]  and January 13, 2001, [26]  respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 [18]  as a single  English -language edition at www.wikipedia.com, [27]  and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [21]  Its policy of \"neutral point-of-view\" [28]  was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. [21]  Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit. [29] The Wikipedia home page on December 20, 2001 English Wikipedia editors with >100 edits per month [30] Number of English Wikipedia articles [31] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,  Slashdot  postings, and web  search engine  indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2003, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. [32] [33]  Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the  Yongle Encyclopedia  made during the  Ming Dynasty  in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600\u00a0years. [34] Citing fears of commercial  advertising  and lack of control, users of the  Spanish Wikipedia forked  from Wikipedia to create  Enciclopedia Libre  in February 2002. [35]  Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from  wikipedia.com  to  wikipedia.org [36] [37] Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [38]  Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [39]  A team at the  Palo Alto Research Center  attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [40]  Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \" low-hanging fruit \"\u2014topics that clearly merit an article\u2014have already been created and built up extensively. [41] [42] [43] \nIn November 2009, a researcher at the  Rey Juan Carlos University  in  Madrid  found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [44] [45] The Wall Street Journal  cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [46]  Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology. [47]  Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\". [48]  A 2013  MIT Technology Review  article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. [49]  In July 2012,  The Atlantic  reported that the number of administrators was also in decline. [50]  In the November 25, 2013, issue of  New York  magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\" [51] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline. [52] [53] Milestones Cartogram  showing number of articles in each European language as of January\u00a02019. [update]  One square represents 10,000 articles. Languages with fewer than 10,000 articles are represented by one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color. In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten  most popular websites  in the US, according to  Comscore  Networks. With 42.9\u00a0million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing  The New York Times  (#10) and  Apple  (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3\u00a0million unique visitors. [54]  As of March\u00a02020 [update] , it ranked 13th [4]  in popularity according to  Alexa Internet . In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month. [55]  On February 9, 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia had 18\u00a0billion  page views  and nearly 500\u00a0million  unique visitors  a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\". [10]  Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \" stigmergic  accumulation\". [56] [57] \nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the  United States Congress \u2014the  Stop Online Piracy Act  (SOPA) and the  PROTECT IP Act  (PIPA)\u2014by  blacking out its pages for 24 hours [58]  More than 162\u00a0million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content. [59] [60] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for  The Economic Times  indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\" [61]  Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's  Knowledge Graphs  project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\" [61]  When contacted on this matter,  Clay Shirky , associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's  Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society  said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\" [61]  By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally. [62] In January 2013,  274301 Wikipedia , an  asteroid , was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the  Wikipedia Monument ; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as  Print Wikipedia . In April 2019, an Israeli  lunar lander Beresheet , crash landed on the surface of the  Moon  carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. [63] [64]  In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16\u00a0GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into  synthetic DNA [65] Current state Screenshot of  English Wikipedia 's article on  Earth , 30 March 2021 On January 23, 2020, the English-language Wikipedia, which is the largest language section of the online encyclopedia,  published its six millionth article By February 2020, Wikipedia ranked eleventh in the world in terms of Internet traffic. [66]  As a key resource for disseminating information related to COVID-19, the World Health Organization has partnered with Wikipedia to help combat the spread of misinformation. [67] [68] Wikipedia accepts cryptocurrency donations and  Basic Attention Token [69] [70] [71] Openness Differences between versions of an article are highlighted Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the  procrastination  principle [note 3]  regarding the security of its content. [72] Restrictions Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [73]  On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees. [74] [75]  A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it. [76]  A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only  administrators  can make changes. [77]  A 2021 article in the  Columbia Journalism Review  identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"[p]erhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\". [78] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the  German Wikipedia  maintains \"stable versions\" of articles [79]  which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012. [80]  Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [81] Wikipedia's editing interface Review of changes Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision. [note 4] [82]  On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's History page. Anyone can view the  latest changes  to articles, and anyone registered may maintain a  \"watchlist\"  of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [83] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low  transaction costs  of participating in a  wiki  created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\". [84] Vandalism Main article:  Vandalism on Wikipedia Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam. [85]  Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively. [86] American journalist  John Seigenthaler  (1927\u20132014), subject of the  Seigenthaler incident Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. [87] [88]  However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair. [89] In the  Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure  John Seigenthaler  in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the  assassination of John F. Kennedy [89]  It remained uncorrected for four months. [89]  Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of  USA Today  and founder of the  Freedom Forum First Amendment Center  at  Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [90] [91]  After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\". [89]  The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people. [92] In 2010, Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show,  Tosh.0 , to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [93] [94] Edit warring Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\". [95] [96]  It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, [97]  and criticized as creating a competitive [98]  and conflict-based [99]  editing culture associated with traditional masculine  gender roles [100] Policies and laws External video Wikimania 60 Minutes CBS , 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales at  Fosdem Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular,  copyright  laws) of the United States and of the US state of  Virginia , where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the \"five pillars\" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. [101]  Editors can  enforce these rules  by  deleting  or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [79] Content policies and guidelines According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is  encyclopedic  and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. [102]  A topic should also meet  Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\" [103]  which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [104]  It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. [105]  This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced. [106]  Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [107] Governance Further information:  Wikipedia:Administration Wikipedia's initial  anarchy  integrated  democratic  and hierarchical elements over time. [108] [109]  An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. [110] Administrators Editors in good standing in the community can request extra  user rights , granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \" adminship [111] [112]  which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits. [113] [114] By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. [115] Dispute resolution Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, [note 5]  seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n Arbitration Committee Main article:  Arbitration Committee The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [116]  functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). when?  Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and  anti-social behavior . When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [117] Community Main article:  Wikipedia community Play media Video of  Wikimania 2005 \u2014an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the  Wikimedia Foundation , was held in  Frankfurt am Main , Germany, August 4\u20138. Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [118] Play media Wikipedians and  British Museum  curators collaborate on the article  Hoxne Hoard  in June 2010 Wikipedia's community has been described as  cultlike [119]  although not always with entirely negative connotations. [120]  Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of  credentials , has been referred to as \" anti-elitism [121] Wikipedians sometimes award one another \"virtual barnstars\" for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [122] Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [123]  As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. [124]  Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community\u00a0... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". [125]  In 2008, a  Slate  magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\" [126]  This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by  Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [127] The English Wikipedia has  6,491,062  articles,  43,474,056  registered editors, and  126,197  active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". [128]  Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, [128]  as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", [129]  but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their  IP addresses  cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n Studies A 2007 study by researchers from  Dartmouth College  found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia\u00a0... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\". [130]  Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\" [125]  However,  Business Insider  editor and journalist  Henry Blodget  showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\". [125] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [131] [132]  although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. [133]  According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\". [134] Diversity Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. [135]  Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including  Yale  and  Brown , gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. [136] Andrew Lih , a professor and scientist, wrote in  The New York Times  that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\". [137]  Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors. [138] Language editions Main article:  List of Wikipedias Distribution of the 58,668,491 articles in different language editions (as of April 28, 2022) [139] English  (11.1%) Cebuano  (10.4%) German  (4.6%) Swedish  (4.4%) French  (4.1%) Dutch  (3.6%) Russian  (3.1%) Spanish  (3%) Italian  (3%) Egyptian Arabic  (2.7%) Polish  (2.6%) Japanese  (2.3%) Vietnamese  (2.2%) Chinese  (2.2%) Waray  (2.2%) Arabic  (2%) Ukrainian  (2%) \u00a0Other (34.5%) Most popular edition of Wikipedia by country in January 2021. Most viewed editions of Wikipedia over time. Most edited editions of Wikipedia over time. There are currently 326 language editions of Wikipedia (also called  language versions , or simply  Wikipedias ). As of April 2022, the six largest, in order of article count, are the  English Cebuano German Swedish French , and  Dutch  Wikipedias. [140]  The second and fourth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating  bot Lsjbot , which as of 2013 [update]  had created about half the articles on the  Swedish Wikipedia , and most of the articles in the  Cebuano  and  Waray Wikipedias . The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\n In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each ( Russian Spanish Italian Egyptian Arabic Polish Japanese Vietnamese Chinese Waray Arabic Ukrainian  and  Portuguese ), seven more have over 500,000 articles ( Persian Catalan Serbian Indonesian Korean Norwegian  and  Finnish ), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000. [141] [140]  The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.4 million articles. As of January\u00a02021, [update]  the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.

A graph for pageviews of  Turkish Wikipedia  shows a large drop of roughly 80% immediately after the  block of Wikipedia in Turkey  was imposed in 2017. Since Wikipedia is based on the  Web  and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the  English edition ). These differences may lead to some conflicts over  spelling differences  (e.g.  colour  versus  color [144]  or points of view. [145] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not  licensed freely  may be used under a claim of  fair use [146] [147] [148] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\". [149]  Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). [150]  For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [151]  and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [152]  The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions [153] Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. [154] A study published by  PLOS One  in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the  English Wikipedia , and 25% for the  simple English Wikipedia [153] English Wikipedia editor numbers Number of editors on the English Wikipedia over time. On March 1, 2014,  The Economist , in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" [155]  The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by  The Economist  as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).  The Economist  reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n In contrast, the trend analysis published in  The Economist  presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. [155]  No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia. [156] Reception See also:  Academic studies about Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2018 Various Wikipedians have  criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [update] [157] [158] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits  systemic bias . In 2010, columnist and journalist  Edwin Black  described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". [159]  Articles in  The Chronicle of Higher Education  and  The Journal of Academic Librarianship  have criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [160] [161] [162] Journalists  Oliver Kamm  and  Edwin Black  alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic. [159] [163]  A 2008 article in  Education Next  Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and  spin [164] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\" [165] In 2022,  John Stossel  opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appears to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics. [166] In 2006, the  Wikipedia Watch  criticism website listed dozens of examples of  plagiarism  in the English Wikipedia. [167] Accuracy of content Main article:  Reliability of Wikipedia External audio The Great Book of Knowledge, Part 1 Ideas with  Paul Kennedy CBC , January 15, 2014 Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. [168]  However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  by the science journal  Nature  found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;  Britannica , about three.\" [169]  Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\" [170]  Others raised similar critiques. [171]  The findings by  Nature  were disputed by  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [172] [173]  and in response,  Nature  gave a rebuttal of the points raised by  Britannica [174]  In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the  Nature  effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in  Nature s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported  confidence intervals ), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small  sample size , 42 or 4 \u00d7 10 1  articles compared, vs >10 5  and >10 6  set sizes for  Britannica  and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [175] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [176]  Concerns have been raised by  PC World  in 2009 regarding the lack of  accountability  that results from users' anonymity, [177]  the insertion of false information, [178] vandalism , and similar problems.\n Economist  Tyler Cowen  wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [179] Amy Bruckman  has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\". [180] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [181]  Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [182]  Editors of traditional  reference works  such as the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  have questioned the project's  utility  and status as an encyclopedia. [183]  Wikipedia co-founder  Jimmy Wales  has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles. [184] External video Inside Wikipedia\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the PR Industry Deutsche Welle , 7:13 mins [185] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for  Internet trolls spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [82] [186] \nIn response to  paid advocacy editing  and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in  The Wall Street Journal , to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [187]  The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.  Katherine Maher , the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia. [187] [188] [189] [190] [191]  These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by  Stephen Colbert  on  The Colbert Report [192] A Harvard law textbook,  Legal Research in a Nutshell  (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\". [193] Discouragement in education This section needs to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. December 2020 Most university  lecturers  discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in  academic work , preferring  primary sources [194]  some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [195] [196]  Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [197]  Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten  emails  weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\" he said. [198] In February 2007, an article in  The Harvard Crimson  newspaper reported that a few of the professors at  Harvard University  were including Wikipedia articles in their  syllabi , although without realizing the articles might change. [199]  In June 2007, former president of the  American Library Association Michael Gorman  condemned Wikipedia, along with  Google , stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\". [200] In contrast, academic writing clarification needed  in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process. [201] Medical information See also:  Health information on Wikipedia On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for  The Atlantic  magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\" [202]  Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of  Amin Azzam  at the  University of San Francisco  to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve  Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by  James Heilman  to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. [202]  In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in  The Atlantic  titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\" [203]  Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\" [203] Coverage of topics and systemic bias See also:  Notability in the English Wikipedia  and  Criticism of Wikipedia \u00a7\u00a0Systemic bias in coverage Parts of this article (those related to  d:Wikidata:Statistics/Wikipedia ) need to be  updated  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. March 2017 Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has  terabytes  of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [204]  The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see  deletionism and inclusionism [205] [206]  Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of  images of Muhammad  in the  English edition  of its  Muhammad  article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the  censorship of Wikipedia  by national authorities in China [207]  and Pakistan, [208]  amongst other countries.\n Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January\u00a02008 [update] [209] A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [209] Culture and Arts: 30% (210%) Biographies and persons: 15% (97%) Geography and places: 14% (52%) Society and social sciences: 12% (83%) History and events: 11% (143%) Natural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%) Technology and Applied Science: 4% (\u22126%) Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%) Health: 2% (42%) Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%) Thought and Philosophy: 1% (160%) These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the  New York Public Library for the Performing Arts  to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [210] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the  University of Minnesota  indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\". [211] Coverage of topics and selection bias Research conducted by Mark Graham of the  Oxford Internet Institute  in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is the most underrepresented. [212]  Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. [213] An editorial in  The Guardian  in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for  a list of female porn actors  than a  list of women writers [214]  Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in  Cape Town  sought to address. [138] Systemic biases When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics,  systemic bias  may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\". [48]  The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's  Technology Review  titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and  policy creep  on the  downward trend in the number of editors [49] Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, vague  for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions. [215]  It may more specifically follow the biases of  Internet culture , inclining to be young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases, intrinsically, may include an overemphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [215] Taha Yasseri  of the  University of Oxford , in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [216] [217]  His research examined the  counterproductive work behavior  of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the  statistical measurement  of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles  George W. Bush anarchism , and  Muhammad [217]  By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the  Oxford  study were for the articles covering  Croatia Scientology , and  9/11 conspiracy theories [217] Researchers from  Washington University  developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. [218] [219] Explicit content See also:  Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia  and  Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons For the government censorship of Wikipedia, see  Censorship of Wikipedia For Wikipedia's policy concerning censorship, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as  feces cadaver human penis vulva , and  nudity ) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.\n The site also includes  sexual content  such as images and videos of  masturbation  and  ejaculation , illustrations of  zoophilia , and photos from  hardcore pornographic  films in its articles. It also has non-sexual  photographs of nude children The Wikipedia article about  Virgin Killer a 1976 album from the  German rock band Scorpions \u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked  prepubescent  girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article  Virgin Killer  was blocked for four days by most  Internet service providers  in the United Kingdom after the  Internet Watch Foundation  (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers. [220] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on  Wikimedia Commons  contained child pornography, and were in violation of  US federal obscenity law [221] [222]  Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to  pedophilia  and one about  lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the  PROTECT Act of 2003 [223]  That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are  obscene under American law [223]  Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [224] Wikimedia Foundation  spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [225]  saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\" [225]  Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\". [226]  Critics, including  Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [227] Privacy One  privacy  concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \" public figure \" in the eyes of the law. [228] [note 6]  It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in  cyberspace  and the right to be anonymous in  real life meatspace \"). A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.\n In January 2006, a German court ordered the  German Wikipedia  shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of  Boris Floricic , aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's  right to privacy  or that of his parents was being violated. [229] Wikipedia has a \" Volunteer Response Team \" that uses Znuny, a  free and open-source software  fork of  OTRS [230]  to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [231] Sexism Main article:  Gender bias on Wikipedia Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of  sexism  and  harassment [232] [233] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language were reasons put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship. [234] Edit-a-thons  have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. [235] A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, found significant gender differences in: confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\" [236] Operation Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates Main article:  Wikimedia Foundation Katherine Maher  became the third executive director of Wikimedia in 2016, succeeding  Lila Tretikov , who had taken over from  Sue Gardner  in 2014. Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the  Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as  Wiktionary  and  Wikibooks . The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [237]  The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7\u00a0million and expenses of almost $29\u00a0million, with assets of $37.2\u00a0million and liabilities of about $2.3\u00a0million. [238] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named  Lila Tretikov  as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [239]  The  Wall Street Journal  reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\" [240] [241]  The same  Wall Street Journal  article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue ( paid advocacy ) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\" Walsh said. [240] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [242]  Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.\" [243] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called  Wikimedia movement affiliates . These include  Wikimedia chapters  (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikim\u00e9dia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the  Catalan language  community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n Software operations and support See also:  MediaWiki The operation of Wikipedia depends on  MediaWiki , a custom-made,  free  and  open source wiki software  platform written in  PHP  and built upon the  MySQL  database system. [244]  The software incorporates programming features such as a  macro language variables , a  transclusion  system for  templates , and  URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the  GNU General Public License  (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on  UseModWiki  written in  Perl  by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required  CamelCase  for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a  PHP wiki  engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by  Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the  exponentially increasing  demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by  Lee Daniel Crocker Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [245]  to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.\n In April 2005, a  Lucene  extension [246] [247]  was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from  MySQL  to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on  Elasticsearch [248] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension,  VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [249] [250] [251] [252]  It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\". [253]  The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n Automated editing Main article:  Wikipedia bots Computer programs called  bots  have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [254] [255] [256]  One controversial contributor,  Sverker Johansson , creating articles with his  bot  was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [257]  Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). [258]  Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. [255]  Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the  MH17 jet  incident in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. [259]  Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. [260] According to  Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [261] Hardware operations and support See also:  Wikimedia Foundation \u00a7\u00a0Hardware Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day. [262] needs update  As of 2021, [update]  page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of  Varnish  caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by  Apache Traffic Server [263]  Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [264]  Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the  Linux Virtual Server  software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. [265] Overview of system architecture as of April\u00a02020 [update] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated  clusters  of  Linux  servers with  Debian [266]  As of December\u00a02009, [update]  there were 300 in Florida and 44 in  Amsterdam [267]  By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an  Equinix  facility in  Ashburn, Virginia [268] [269]  In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in  Singapore , the first of its kind in Asia. [270] Internal research and operational development Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [49]  the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of  industrial organization  economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [271]  Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized \"Thank\" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [49] [253]  The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [272]  At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45\u00a0million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8\u00a0million and 11.3\u00a0million dollars annually. [272]  In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by  Bloomberg News  as being at $77\u00a0million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08\u00a0million and $19.2\u00a0million annually. [272] Internal news publications Community-produced news publications include the  English Wikipedia 's  The Signpost , founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator, and former chair of the  Wikimedia Foundation  board of trustees. [273]  It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other  Wikimedia projects , such as  Wikimedia Commons . Similar publications are the German-language  Kurier , and the Portuguese-language  Correio da Wikip\u00e9dia . Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the  Wikiworld  webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like  The Bugle  from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also several publications from the  Wikimedia Foundation  and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff and  This Month in Education The Wikipedia Library For information for Wikipedia editors, see  Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of  digital publications , so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. [274] [275]  Over  60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when  ICE Publishing  joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources \u2013 creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\" [276] Access to content Content licensing When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the  GNU Free Documentation License  (GFDL), a  copyleft  license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [277]  The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with  free software  programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the  Creative Commons license  was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [278]  Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the  Free Software Foundation  (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to  relicense its content to CC BY-SA  by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [279] [280] [281] [282] The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under  fair use  doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in  Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by  free content  licenses (e.g.  Creative Commons ' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via  Wikimedia Commons  repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [283] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [284] [285] Methods of access Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\n Websites : Thousands of \" mirror sites \" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are  Reference.com  and  Answers.com . Another example is  Wapedia , which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Mobile apps : A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on  hand-held devices , including both  Android  and  iOS  devices (see  Wikipedia apps ). (see also  Mobile access Search engines : Some web  search engines  make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include  Microsoft Bing  (via technology gained from  Powerset [286]  and  DuckDuckGo Compact discs, DVDs : Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on  optical discs . An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles. [287] [288]  The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles. [289]  There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well. [290] [291]  Also, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and  SOS Children , is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the  UK National Curriculum  and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world. [292]  The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes. Printed books : There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. [293] [294]  Since 2009, tens of thousands of  print-on-demand  books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company  Books LLC  and by three  Mauritian  subsidiaries of the German publisher  VDM [295] Semantic Web : The website  DBpedia , begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the  Wikidata  project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable  semantic  format,  RDF . As of April\u00a02021, [update]  it has 93,337,731 items. Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a  web crawler  is discouraged. [296]  Wikipedia publishes  \"dumps\"  of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 [update]  there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [297] Wikimedia Enterprise  is a for-profit solution to this.\n Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the  Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library  reference desk , with an accuracy of 55 percent. [298] Mobile access See also:  Help:Mobile access The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page, from August 3, 2019 Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard  web browser  through a fixed  Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the  mobile web  since July 2013,  The New York Times  on February 9, 2014, quoted  Erik M\u00f6ller , deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [10]  The article in  The New York Times  reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" [10] The New York Times  reports that M\u00f6ller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by  The New York Times  for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [10] Bloomberg Businessweek  reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. [299]  At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with  Sue Gardner  in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [241]  The  Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [300]  The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [301]  Later versions have also been released.\n Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the  Wireless Application Protocol  (WAP), via the  Wapedia  service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, [302]  located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the  iPhone Android -based devices or  WebOS -based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia  metadata , such as  geoinformation [303] [304] Wikipedia Zero  was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. [305]  It was discontinued in February 2018. [306] Andrew Lih  and  Andrew Brown  both maintain editing Wikipedia with  smartphones  is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of  MIT Technology Review  claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some  Wikipedians  use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the  status quo [49]  Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it. [307] [308] Chinese access Access to the  Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked  in  mainland China  since May 2015. [309] [310] [311]  This was done after Wikipedia started to use  HTTPS  encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult. [312] In 2017,  Quartz  reported that the Chinese government had begun creating an unofficial version of Wikipedia. However, unlike Wikipedia, the website's contents would only be editable by scholars from state-owned Chinese institutions. The article stated it had been approved by the  State Council of the People's Republic of China  in 2011. [313] Cultural impact Trusted source to combat fake news In 2017\u201318, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.  Noam Cohen , writing in  The Washington Post  states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out ' fake news [15]  As of November\u00a02020, [update]  Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.03 and the average daily time on site as 3:46 minutes. [4] Readership In February 2014,  The New York Times  reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\" [10]  However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. [314] In addition to  logistic growth  in the number of its articles, [315]  Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [316]  About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, [317]  a good portion of which is related to academic research. [318]  The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365\u00a0million at the end of 2009. [319]  The  Pew  Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [320]  In 2011  Business Insider  gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4\u00a0billion if it ran advertisements. [321] According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [322] COVID-19 pandemic Main article:  Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic During the  COVID-19 pandemic , Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. [323] Cultural significance \"Wikipedia in webcomics\" redirects here. For the list of Wikipedia's appearances in webcomics, see  Wikipedia:Wikipedia in webcomics Main article:  Wikipedia in culture Wikipedia Monument  in  S\u0142ubice , Poland (2014, by  Mihran Hakobyan Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [324] [325] [326]  The  Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on  same-sex marriage  in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the  Civil Marriage Act [327]  The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the  World Intellectual Property Organization [328] \u2014though mainly for  supporting information  rather than information decisive to a case. [329]  Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some  US intelligence agency  reports. [330]  In December 2008, the scientific journal  RNA Biology  launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the  RNA family  for publication in Wikipedia. [331] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [332] [333]  often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for  plagiarizing from Wikipedia [334] [335] [336] In 2006,  Time  magazine  recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with  YouTube Reddit MySpace , and  Facebook [337]  in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.\n In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on  BBC Radio 4 [338]  which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select group of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ( Google Facebook YouTube ) that they no longer need explanation.\n On September 28, 2007,  Italian  politician  Franco Grillini  raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of  freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [339] Play media Wikipedia, an introduction \u2013  Erasmus Prize  2015 Jimmy Wales  accepts the 2008  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award on behalf of Wikipedia On September 16, 2007,  The Washington Post  reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the  2008 US election campaign , saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\" [340]  An October 2007  Reuters  article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [341] Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. [342] A working group led by  Peter Stone  (formed as a part of the  Stanford -based project  One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence ) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\" [343] In a 2017 opinion piece for  Wired Hossein Derakhshan  describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the  open  and  decentralized web \" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with  social media  and  social networking services , the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the  Age of Enlightenment  tradition of  rationality  triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a  typographic  culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \" sapere aude lit. ''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of \"[d]are not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television\u2014how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\" [344] Awards Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [345]  The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual  Prix Ars Electronica  contest; this came with a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a36,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in  Austria  later that year. The second was a Judges'  Webby Award  for the \"community\" category. [346] In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\" [347] In September 2008, Wikipedia received  Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment  award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with  Boris Tadi\u0107 Eckart H\u00f6fling , and  Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by  David Weinberger [348] In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual  Erasmus Prize , which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, [349]  and the  Spanish Princess of Asturias Award  on International Cooperation. [350]  Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony,  Jimmy Wales  praised the work of the  Asturian language  Wikipedia users. [351] Satire See also:  Category:Parodies of Wikipedia Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\n Comedian  Stephen Colbert  has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show  The Colbert Report  and coined the related term  wikiality , meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on\u2014the reality we just agreed on\". [192]  Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in  The Onion [352]  as well as the 2010  The Onion  article \"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\". [353] In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy  The Office , office manager ( Michael Scott ) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on  negotiation  tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [354]  Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. [355] My Number One Doctor \", a 2007 episode of the television show  Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which  Perry Cox  reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the  raw food diet  reverses the effects of  bone cancer  by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the  Battlestar Galactica  episode guide [356] In 2008, the comedy website  CollegeHumor  produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [357] The  Dilbert  comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\" [358] In July 2009,  BBC Radio 4  broadcast a comedy series called  Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [359] On August 23, 2013, the  New Yorker  website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit,  Manning , have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\" [360]  The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a  trans woman In December 2015,  John Julius Norwich  stated, in a letter published in  The Times  newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [361] [362] Sister projects\u00a0\u2013 Wikimedia Main article:  Wikimedia project Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the  Wikimedia Foundation . These other  Wikimedia projects  include  Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [363] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,  Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,  Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,  Wikinews , for citizen journalism, and  Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [364]  Another sister project of Wikipedia,  Wikispecies , is a catalogue of species. In 2012  Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, and  Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched.\n Publishing A group of Wikimedians of the  Wikimedia DC  chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (back left)  at the US National Archives The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g.  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [365] [366] [367] Nicholas Carr  wrote a 2005 essay, \"The amorality of  Web 2.0 \", that criticized websites with  user-generated content , like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote: \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\" [368]  Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance,  Chris Anderson , the editor-in-chief of  Wired Magazine , wrote in  Nature  that the \" wisdom of crowds \" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top  scientific journals , with their rigorous  peer review  process. [369] There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" said  Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of  The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton  and  George Eliot: the Last Victorian [370] Research use Wikipedia has been widely used as a  corpus  for linguistic research in  computational linguistics information retrieval  and  natural language processing . In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the  entity linking  problem, which is then called \"wikification\", [371]  and to the related problem of  word-sense disambiguation [372]  Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia. [373] In 2015, French researchers Jos\u00e9 Lages of the  University of Franche-Comt\u00e9  in  Besan\u00e7on  and Dima Shepelyansky of  Paul Sabatier University  in  Toulouse  published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. [374] [375] [376]  They used  PageRank CheiRank  and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\". [376] [377]  The study was updated in 2019. [378] A 2017  MIT  study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. [379] [380] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using  machine learning  and  artificial intelligence  to support various operations. One of the most important areas\u2014automatic detection of vandalism [381] [382]  and  data quality  assessment in Wikipedia. [383] In February 2022,  civil servants  from the UK's  Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities  were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the  Levelling Up White Paper  after journalists at  The Independent  noted that parts of the  document  had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on  Constantinople  and the  list of largest cities throughout history [384] Related projects Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986  BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on  BBC Micro  computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [385] Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.  Everything2 [386]  with many later being merged into the project (e.g.  GNE [387]  One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was  h2g2 , which was created by  Douglas Adams  in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n Subsequent collaborative  knowledge  websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia.  Some, such as  Susning.nu Enciclopedia Libre Hudong , and  Baidu Baike  likewise employ no formal review process, although some like  Conservapedia  are not as open. citation needed  Others use more traditional  peer review , such as  Encyclopedia of Life  and the online wiki encyclopedias  Scholarpedia  and  Citizendium . The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

Retrieved  March 26,  2021 There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

This page is for documenting and explaining the English Wikipedia  policy  on page protection. Are you trying to request protection of a page?

Pages are protected when a specific damaging event has been identified that can not be prevented through other means such as a  block . Otherwise, Wikipedia is built on the principle that  anyone can edit it , and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. This policy states in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and when each protection should and should not be applied.\n Protection is a technical restriction applied only by  administrators , although any user may  request protection . Protection can be  indefinite  or expire after a specified time. The various levels of protection are detailed below, and they can be applied to the page edit, page move, page create, and file upload actions. Even when a page is protected from editing, the  source code wikitext ) of the page can still be viewed and copied by anyone.\n A protected page is marked at its top right by a padlock icon, usually added by the  pp-protected  template.\n Contents 1 Types of protection 1.1 Full protection 1.1.1 Content disputes 1.1.2 Vandalism 1.1.3 \"History only\" review 1.1.4 Protected generic file names 1.1.5 Permanent protection 1.2 Template protection 1.3 Semi-protection 1.3.1 Guidance for administrators 1.4 Creation protection (salting) 1.5 Move protection 1.6 Upload protection 1.7 Pending changes protection 1.7.1 When to apply pending changes protection 1.8 Extended confirmed protection 1.9 Office actions 1.10 Cascading protection 2 Former deleted protections 2.1 Superprotect 2.2 Cascading semi-protection 2.3 Pending changes protection level\u00a02 3 Protection by namespace 3.1 Article talk pages 3.2 User talk pages 3.2.1 Blocked users 3.3 User pages 3.3.1 Deceased users 3.4 Protection of templates 3.5 Sandboxes 4 Available templates 5 See also 6 Notes Types of protection Shortcut WP:PPLIST The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages:\n Edit protection  protects the page from being  edited Move protection  protects the page from being  moved or renamed Creation protection  prevents a page (normally a previously  deleted  one) from being created (also known as \" salting Upload protection  prevents new versions of a file from being  uploaded , but it does not prevent editing to the file's description page (unless edit protection is applied). The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages:\n Pending changes protection (only available for edit protection)  means edits by unregistered and new editors are not visible to readers who are not logged-in until the edits are approved by a  reviewer  or an administrator. Semi-protection  prevents the action by unregistered editors and editors with accounts that are not  confirmed Extended confirmed protection , also known as  30/500 protection , prevents the action by users without 30 days' tenure and 500 edits on the English Wikipedia. In most cases it should not be a protection level of first resort, and should be used where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. Its use is logged at the  Administrators' noticeboard Template protection  prevents the action by everyone except  template editors  and  administrators  (who have this right as part of their toolset). Full protection  prevents the action by everyone except  administrators Any type of protection (with the exception of  cascading protection ) may be requested at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection . Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding  talk page , then carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or there is  consensus  for them.\n Except in the case of  office actions  (see  below Arbitration Committee  remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace (see  below ), administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary. Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at  Requests for unprotection . Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first. A log of protections and unprotections is available at  Special:Log/protect Interaction of Wikipedia user groups and page protection levels\n Unregistered  or  Newly registered Confirmed  or  Auto-confirmed Extended confirmed Template editor Admin Interface admin Appropriate for\n No protection\n normal editing The vast majority of pages. (This is the default protection level.)\n Pending changes protection all users can edit. Edits by  unregistered or new editors  (and any subsequent edits by  anyone ) are hidden from readers who are not logged in, until reviewed by a  pending changes reviewer  or  admin . Logged-in editors see all edits, whether accepted or not.\n Infrequently edited pages with high levels of vandalism,  BLP  violations, edit-warring, or other disruption from unregistered and new users\n Semi-protection cannot edit normal editing Pages that are frequently edited by anonymous and registered users; some highly visible templates & modules\n Extended- confirmed prot. cannot edit normal editing Specific topic areas authorized by  ArbCom ; pages where semi-protection has failed;  high-risk templates  where template protection would be too restrictive\n Template prot. cannot edit normal editing High-risk  or very frequently used templates & modules; also  some  high-risk pages outside  template space Full protection cannot edit normal editing Articles with persistent disruption from extended confirmed accounts; critical templates & modules\n Interface protection cannot edit normal editing Scripts, stylesheets, and similar objects central to operation of the site\n  In order to edit through extended confirmed protection, a template editor must also be extended confirmed, but in practice this is essentially always the case.\n Other modes of protection:\n Create protection Move protection Upload protection Office protection Cascade protection view talk edit Full protection Shortcuts WP:FULL WP:GOLDLOCK A fully protected page cannot be edited or moved by anyone except  administrators . The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.\n Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit fully-protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Content disputes See also:  Wikipedia:Stable version \"WP:PREFER\" redirects here. For what title name should be preferred, see  Wikipedia:Disambiguation \u00a7\u00a0Primary topic While content disputes and  edit warring  may be addressed with user  blocks  issued by  uninvolved  administrators, allowing normal page editing by other editors at the same time, the protection policy provides an alternative approach as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war. This approach may better suit multi-party disputes and contentious content, as it makes talk page  consensus  a requirement for implementation of  requested edits Shortcut WP:PREFER When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as  vandalism copyright violations defamation , or  poor-quality coverage of living people . Administrators are deemed to remain uninvolved when exercising discretion on whether to apply protection to the current version of an article, or to an older,  stable , or pre-edit-war version.\n Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version  prior to  the edit war and  request  reversion to that version. Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.\n Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered  involved  and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions. When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.\n Vandalism Shortcuts WP:NO-PREEMPT WP:PREEMPTIVE Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons. However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring by multiple users and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.\n \"History only\" review Shortcut WP:PPDRV If a deleted page is going through  deletion review , only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page. If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may  restore  the page, blank it or replace the contents with  Temporarily undeleted  template or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing. The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the  page history  Protected generic file names Generic file names such as  File:Photo.jpg File:Map.jpg , and  File:Sound.wav  are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded. Furthermore,  File:Map.jpg  and  File:Sound.wav  are  salted Permanent protection Shortcuts WP:PPINDEF WP:REDLOCK Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia, which are permanently protected by the  MediaWiki  software:\n Edits to the  MediaWiki namespace , which defines parts of the site interface, are restricted to administrators.\n Edits to system-wide CSS and JavaScript pages such as  MediaWiki:common.js  are further restricted to  interface administrators Edits to personal CSS and JavaScript pages such as  User:Example/monobook.css  and  User:Example/cologneblue.js  are restricted to the associated user and interface administrators. Interface administrators may edit these pages, for example, to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way. Administrators may delete (but not edit or restore) these pages. Edits to personal JSON pages such as  User:Example/data.json  are restricted to the associated user and administrators. Such protection is called Permanent, Interface, or Indefinite protection; and pages so protected can only be edited by those with  Interface Administrator rights In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually fully protected for an indefinite period of time (though not necessarily with Interface protection):\n Pages that are very visible, such as the  Main Page Pages that should not be modified for copyright or legal reasons, such as the  general disclaimer  or the  local copy of the site copyright license Pages that are very frequently  transcluded , such as  tl  or  citation needed , to prevent  vandalism  or  denial of service  attacks. This includes images or templates used in other highly visible or frequently transcluded pages. See  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  for more information. Template protection Main page:  Wikipedia:Template editor Shortcuts WP:TPROT WP:PINKLOCK A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the Template editors group. This protection level should be used almost exclusively on  high-risk templates  and  modules . In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.\n This is a protection level [1]  that replaces  full protection  on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes. It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection. It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the  template editor  user right exists\u2014the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community. In borderline cases,  extended confirmed protection  or lower may be applied to high risk templates that the general editing community still needs to edit regularly.\n Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit template-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Semi-protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection Shortcuts WP:SEMI WP:SILVERLOCK Semi-protected pages cannot be edited by  unregistered users IP addresses ), as well as accounts that are not  autoconfirmed  (accounts that are at least four days old and have made at least ten edits to Wikipedia) or  confirmed . Semi-protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or  vandalism  from new or unregistered users, or to prevent  sockpuppets  of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on  biographies of living persons  who have had a recent high level of media interest. An alternative to semi-protection is  pending changes , which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.\n Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{ Edit semi-protected }} template if necessary to gain attention. If the page in question and its talk page are  both  protected, please make your edit request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection  instead. New users may also request the confirmed user right at  Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed Guidance for administrators Administrators may apply  indefinite  semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent  vandalism  or violations of  content policy  (such as  biographies of living persons neutral point of view ). Semi-protection should  not  be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred or to privilege registered users over unregistered users in (valid) content disputes.\n In addition, administrators may apply  temporary  semi-protection on pages that are:\n Subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to  media attention ) if  blocking  individual users is not a feasible option. Subject to  edit warring  if  all  parties involved are unregistered or new editors (i.e. in cases in which full protection would otherwise be applied). This does  not  apply when autoconfirmed users are involved. Subject to  vandalism  or  edit warring  where unregistered editors are engaging in  IP hopping  by using different computers, obtaining new addresses by using  dynamic IP  allocation, or other address-changing schemes. Article discussion pages, if they have been subject to persistent disruption. Such protection should be used sparingly because it prevents unregistered and newly registered users from participating in discussions. A page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time. If a page and its talk page are both protected, the talk page should direct affected editors to  Wikipedia:Request for edit  to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing. Protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users, including IP addresses. Instead the user should be re-blocked with talk page editing disallowed. When required, or when re-blocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful, protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block. Today's featured article  may be semi-protected just like any other article. But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances. For the former guideline, see  Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection Creation protection (salting) Shortcuts WP:SALT WP:SKYBLUELOCK Administrators can prevent the creation of pages. This level of protection is useful for pages that have been  deleted  but repeatedly recreated. Such protection is case-sensitive. There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection. A list of protected titles may be found at  Special:ProtectedTitles  (see also  historical lists Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the  title blacklist  system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for  substrings  and  regular expressions Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as \" salted \". Editors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an  administrator  (preferably the protecting administrator), file a request at  Wikipedia:Requests for page protection#Current requests for reduction in protection level , or use the  deletion review  process. To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a  draft version  of the intended article when filing a request.\n Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection\u2014autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, [2]  or full. Due to the implementation of  ACPERM , non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in  mainspace ; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.\n While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user (or  sockpuppets  of that user, if applicable).\n Move protection Shortcuts WP:MOVP WP:GREENLOCK Move-protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator. Move protection is commonly applied to:\n Pages subject to persistent page-move  vandalism Pages subject to a page-name dispute. Highly visible pages that have no reason to be moved, such as the  administrators' noticeboard  and articles selected as \" Today's featured article \" on the main page. Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.\n As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring  should not be considered an endorsement of the current name . When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.\n All  files  are implicitly move-protected; only  file movers  and administrators can rename files.\n Upload protection Shortcuts WP:UPLOAD-P WP:PURPLELOCK Upload-protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator. Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing. It may be applied by an administrator to:\n Files subject to persistent upload  vandalism Files subject to a dispute between editors. Files that should not be replaced, such as images used in the interface or transcluded to the main page. Files with common or generic names. (e.g.,  File:Map.png As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current version. An exception to this rule is when they are protected due to upload vandalism.\n Pending changes protection Further information:  Wikipedia:Pending changes Shortcuts WP:PCPP WP:WHITELOCK Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress  vandalism  and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits. Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi-protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from most readers until those changes are accepted by a  pending changes reviewer When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  unregistered  (IP addresses) editor or a  new user , the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the  pending changes reviewer right . When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an  autoconfirmed user , the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers, unless there are pending edits waiting to be reviewed.\n Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review. Readers that are  not logged in  (the vast majority of readers) are shown the latest  accepted  version of the page;  logged-in  users see the latest version of the page, with all changes (reviewed or not) applied. When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.\n A user who clicks \"edit this page\" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing  regardless of whether the user is logged in or not If the editor is not logged in, their changes join any other changes to the article awaiting review\u00a0\u2013 for the present they remain hidden from not-logged-in users. (This means that when the editor looks at the article after saving, the editor won't see the change made.) If the editor is logged in and a pending changes reviewer, and there are pending changes, the editor will be prompted to review the pending changes before editing\u00a0\u2013 see  Wikipedia:Pending changes If the editor is logged in and not a pending changes reviewer, then If there are no unreviewed pending edits waiting, this editor's edits will be visible to everyone immediately; but If there are unreviewed pending edits waiting, then this editor's edits will be visible only to other logged-in users (including themself) immediately, but not to readers not logged in. Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.\n When to apply pending changes protection Pending changes may be used to protect articles against:\n Persistent vandalism Violations of the  biographies of living persons  policy Copyright violations Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. Like semi-protection, PC protection should  never  be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Instead, semi-protection should be considered.\n In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.\n Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at  requests for unprotection The reviewing process is described in detail at  Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes Extended confirmed protection See also:  Wikipedia:Rough guide to extended confirmed protection Shortcuts WP:ECP WP:BLUELOCK Extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, only allows edits by editors with the  extended confirmed  user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days' tenure and 500 edits.\n Where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption (such as  vandalism , abusive  sockpuppetry edit wars , etc.) on any topic. Extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered/new users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by Arbitration Committee 30/500 rulings. Extended confirmed protection may be applied at the discretion of an administrator when creation-protecting a page. [2] High-risk templates  may be extended-confirmed protected at administrator discretion when template protection would be too restrictive and semi-protection would be ineffective to stop widespread disruption. [3] Until August 12, 2016, [4]  30/500 protection applied only in topic areas determined by the  Arbitration Committee , which authorized its use on articles reasonably construed as belonging to the  Arab\u2013Israeli conflict [5]  as an arbitration enforcement tool by motion or remedy; [6]  or as a result of community consensus. [7]  In February 2019, the community authorized uninvolved administrators to place pages reasonably construed as belonging to the  India\u2013Pakistan conflict  under extended confirmed protection as part of a general sanctions regime. [8]  In May 2020 the Arbitration Committee authorized extended confirmed protection to pages related to the history of Jews and  antisemitism in Poland  during World War II (1933\u20131945). [9] As of September 23, 2016, a bot posts a notification in a subsection of  AN  when this protection level is used. [10]  Any protection made as arbitration enforcement must be logged at  Wikipedia:Arbitration enforcement log . A full list of the 3709 pages under 30/500 protection can be found  here Users can request edits to an extended confirmed-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the  Edit extended-protected  template if necessary to gain attention.\n Office actions See also:  Wikipedia:Office actions Shortcuts WP:WMF-PRO WP:BLACKLOCK As outlined in  Meta-Wiki:Office actions#Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff , pages may be protected by  Wikimedia Foundation  staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel.  Such actions override community consensus . Administrators should  not  edit or unprotect such pages without permission from Wikimedia Foundation staff. [11] Cascading protection \"WP:CASCADE\" redirects here. You may also be looking for  Help:Cascading Style Sheets  or  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items Shortcuts WP:CASCADE WP:TURQUOISELOCK Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection  automatically  to any page that is  transcluded  onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly. This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia. Files stored on Commons are  not  protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and, if they are to be protected, must be either temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or explicitly protected at Commons (whether manually or through cascading protection there). When operational,  KrinkleBot  cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection  and  Main Page . As the bot's response time varies, media should  not  be transcluded on the main page (or its constituent templates) until after it has been protected. (This is particularly relevant to  Template:In the news , for which upcoming images are not queued at  Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow .) Cascading protection:\n Should be used only to prevent  vandalism  when placed on particularly visible pages, such as the main page. Is available only for fully protected pages; it is disabled for lower levels of protection as it represents a workflow flaw. See  below  as well as  this bug ticket  for more information. Is not instantaneous; it may be several hours before it takes effect. See  Phabricator:T20483  for more information. Should generally not be applied directly to templates or  modules , as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the  documentation subpage See  \u00a7\u00a0Protection of templates  below , for alternatives. The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at  Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items . Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at  Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items  as an  edit request Former deleted protections Superprotect Shortcut WP:SUPERPROTECT See also:  Meta-Wiki:Superprotect Superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by  Wikimedia Foundation employees who are in the Staff global group . It was  implemented on August 10, 2014  and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the  German Wikipedia 's primary site JavaScript,  common.js . It was never used on the English Wikipedia. On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to  remove  superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.\n Cascading semi-protection Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after  users noticed  that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.\n Pending changes protection level\u00a02 Shortcut WP:ORANGELOCK Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not  pending changes reviewers  to be reviewed. Following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017. It was suggested then that \"Pending changes level 1\" be referred to in the future as simply \"Pending changes\". [12] Protection by namespace Shortcut WP:PROTNS Article talk pages Shortcut WP:ATPROT \nModifications to a protected page can be proposed on its  talk page  (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting  consensus . Placing the  Edit protected  template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.\n Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.\n User talk pages Shortcut WP:UTPROT User talk pages are rarely protected. However, protection may be applied if there is severe vandalism or abuse. Users whose talk pages are protected may wish to have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from users that the protection restricts editing from.\n A user's request to have their own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.\n Blocked users Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.\n In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{ unblock }} template, re-blocking the user with talk page access removed should be preferred over applying protection to the page. If the user has been blocked and with the ability to edit their user talk page disabled, they should be informed of this in a block notice, subsequent notice, or message, and it should include information and instructions for appealing their block off-wiki, such as through the  UTRS tool interface  or, as a last recourse,  the Arbitration Committee When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.\n Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with  Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry ; their pages are not normally protected.\n User pages Shortcuts WP:UPROT WP:UPPROT Base user pages (for example, the page User:Example, and not User:Example/subpage or User talk:Example) are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed accounts and anonymous IP users. An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered account attempting to create or edit their own user page. IP editors and unconfirmed accounts are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a currently-registered account. This protection is enforced by  an edit filter [13]  Users may opt-out of this protection by placing  unlocked userpage  anywhere on their own user page.\n User pages  and subpages within their own user space may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists. Pages within the user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected without good reason or cause. [14] [15]  Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.\n When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a \".css\" subpage (ex. User:Example/Userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting  {{User:Example/Userpage.css}}  on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. Because user space pages that end in \".css\", \".js\", and \".json\" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.\n Deceased users See also:  Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.\n Protection of templates Shortcut WP:PTPROT See also:  Wikipedia:High-risk templates  and  Wikipedia:Template documentation Highly visible templates\u00a0\u2013 those used on a large number of pages or frequently substituted\u00a0\u2013 are often edit protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, and other considerations.\n Protected templates should normally have the {{ documentation }} template. It loads the unprotected  /doc  page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. It also automatically adds {{ pp-template }} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. Only manually add  {{pp-template}}  to protected templates that don't use  {{documentation}}  (mostly the flag templates).\n Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside  <includeonly>  tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but  will  protect the template's  documentation subpage . Instead, consider any of the following:\n If the set of subtemplates is static (even if large), protect them using normal protection mechanisms. If the set of subtemplates is unbounded, use  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist  to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format (as is done for  editnotice templates  and subtemplates of  Template:TFA title Note: All  editnotice templates  (except those in userspace) are already protected via  MediaWiki:Titleblacklist . They can be edited by admins,  template editors  and  page movers  only.\n Sandboxes See also:  Wikipedia:About the sandbox Sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with  wiki syntax . Most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users. The  Wikipedia:Sandbox  is cleaned every hour. Those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as  no personal attacks civility , or  copyrights , should instead be warned and/or blocked.\n Available templates The following templates may be added at the very top of a page to indicate that it is protected:\n Protection templates Edit Move Pending changes Upload  Generic pp pp-protected {{pp}} pp-move {{pp}} pp-pc {{pp}} pp-upload BLP pp-blp  Dispute pp-dispute pp-move-dispute Extended confirmed protection pp-extended pp-extended Main Page  Image pp-main-page Office pp-office pp-reset pp-office-dmca {{pp-office}} {{pp-reset}} {{pp-office-dmca}} {{pp-office}} {{pp-reset}} {{pp-office-dmca}}  Sockpuppetry pp-sock  High-visibility pp-template  Blocked user's talk pp-usertalk  Vandalism pp-vandalism pp-move-vandalism  Talk page permanently protected temporarily protected  Long-term pp-semi-indef pp-move-indef Module:Protection banner On redirect pages, use the {{ Redirect category shell }} template, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line. A protection template may also be added below the redirect line, but it will serve only to categorize the page, as it will not be visible on the page, and it will have to be manually removed when protection is removed.\n See also MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext Special:ProtectedPages Special:ProtectedTitles Wikipedia:Edit lock Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages Wikipedia:Requests for page protection Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection Wikipedia:Make protection requests sparingly , an essay Meta-Wiki:Protected pages considered harmful Meta-Wiki:The Wrong Version Wikipedia:Protection policy/Padlocks Notes Created October 2013 as a result of  Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Template editor user right\u200e a b Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Extended confirmed protection policy 2 Should we use ECP on templates?  discussion at the village pump.

Please read up on the  protection policy . Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to  high-risk templates ; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the  rough guide to semi-protection ); and move protection is used to stop  pagemove  revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the  rough guide to extended confirmed protection After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on  Special:Protectedpages . Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of  obvious vandalism Note : Editors should  not  consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken.\n Skip to  table of contents requests to  raise protection lower protection requested edits (purge) Request  protection  of a page, or increasing the protection level Request protection Request  unprotection  of a page, or reducing the protection level Request unprotection Request a specific  edit  to a protected page Please request an edit directly on the protected page's  talk page  before posting here this header view edit Archives 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Administrator instructions Contents 1 Current requests for increase in protection level 1.1 Acharya (2022 film) 1.2 Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents 1.3 Kara\u0111or\u0111e 1.4 Naomi Judd 1.5 Drukpa Kagyu: Conversion by Karma Kagyu 1.6 User talk:Q-bit array 1.7 Alpha Jallow 1.8 Kit Connor 1.9 Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori 1.10 Male expendability 1.11 Death of Elisa Lam 2 Current requests for reduction in protection level 2.1 Philippine Airlines 3 Current requests for edits to a protected page 3.1 Lucifer Valentine 4 Handled requests Current  requests for increase  in protection level Request  protection  of a page, or increasing the protection level Request protection Shortcut WP:RPP/I Acharya (2022 film) Acharya (2022 film) edit talk history links watch logs Temporary semi-protection:  Please protect this Telugu film article.

It has been barred from editing for almost 11 years. I made a case on the talk page, which I will copy here.\nI am requesting recreation as Lucifer Valentine has received significant media attention since this page was locked in 2011. He has made many new movies, committed crimes, and been given awards. Additionally, with the way this is set up, we would have to make several pages for each individual movie that all include information on him, rather than have 1 page that discusses him connected to the several movie pages. He was also in a documentary called  Beyond Horror: The History and Sub-Culture of Red Films  in 2019 which means he meets notability guidelines. He's also mentioned  here here  and  here  . If he's notable enough to have a Fandago page and sell his 2015 movie (not in the Vomit Dolls triology) at Booksamillion, I'm sure he is notable enough for Wikipedia. He also has over 19 film credits now. \nLucifer Valentine is a widely discussed topic on social media, has several film nominations, has been featured in documentaries, and there is extensive content on him Wikipedia would be able to cover. This would make it much more user-friendly for all of his movie pages and provide reliable information on a highly sought after topic. Perhaps he was not as notable in 2011 when this page was locked, but there is a case to be made for his notability now.  CherriGasoline talk ) 04:16, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply ReaderofthePack : Pinging the protecting administrator ReaderofthePack.  Malcolmxl5 talk ) 11:08, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply I don't mind, but I highly suggest making a draft first and making sure that he passes notability guidelines. Keep in mind that having a Fandango page doesn't necessarily mean that someone is notable. Also, part of the issue here was that he was predominantly known for his Vomit Dolls trilogy, so the big emphasis here would be showing how he's notable for more than just that series. There are some  self-published sources  like blogs and so on that cover him, but coverage in places that Wikipedia would see as both reliable and notability giving are pretty slim. Some tend to focus on the Vomit Dolls trilogy or discuss his films as part of one ongoing series. Now that said, I do see coverage  here  and  here , as well as at  Ginger Nuts of Horror , which is good. But again, you need to establish how he's notable apart from his Vomit Dolls work. I highly recommend creating a draft before moving anything live and getting one of us to look it over - I don't mind taking a look. The page was deleted in the past so there's more chance that someone will try to renominate it unless it passes notability guidelines per  WP:NBIO  and has strong sourcing. There's a brochure on creating biography articles  here  that would definitely help with that.  ReaderofthePack (formerly Tokyogirl79)  12:16, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply Also, please read over  WP:NCRIME  - given this aspect I'd like to see a draft before unprotecting the page. You can create one at  WP:AfC ReaderofthePack (formerly Tokyogirl79)  12:17, 27 April 2022 (UTC) reply CherriGasoline . ReaderofthePack has given you advice, essentially to create a draft of your proposed article - you can use  WP:AFC  for this. Can we close this now?
